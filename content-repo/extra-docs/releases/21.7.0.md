### New: Windows Forensics Pack v1.0.0
#### Incident Types
**Forensic Acquisition And Analysis**

#### Layouts
**Forensic Acquisition And Analysis**
(Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.0.0).
#### Playbooks
##### Acquire And Analyze Host Forensics
Enables gathering forensic data from a host and analyzing the acquired data by using the relevant forensics automations.
##### Forensics Tools Analysis
Enables the user to analyze forensic evidence acquired from a host, such as registry files and PCAP files.
##### PS-Remote Acquire Host Forensics
Enables the user to gather multiple forensic data from a Windows endpoint including network traffic, MFT (Master File Table), and registry export by using the PS Remote automation which enables connecting to a Windows host without the need to install any 3rd-party tools using just native Windows management tools.
##### PS Remote Get File Sample From Path
Leverages the Windows built-in PowerShell and WinRM capabilities to connect to a Windows host to acquire a file as forensic evidence for further analysis.
##### PS-Remote Get MFT
Leverages the Windows built-in PowerShell and WinRM capabilities to connect to a Windows host to acquire and export the MFT (Master File Table) as forensic evidence for further analysis.
##### PS-Remote Get Network Traffic
Leverages the Windows built-in PowerShell and WinRM capabilities to connect to a Windows host. It then connects to the Netsh tool to create an ETL file which is the equivalent of a Wireshark PCAP file by using the PS-Remote integration. After receiving the resultant ETL, XSOAR will be able to convert the ETL to a PCAP file to be parsed and enriched later. Review the Microsoft documentation for how to use ETL filters (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/jj129382(v=ws.11)#using-filters-to-limit-etl-trace-file-details).
##### PS-Remote Get Registry
Leverages the Windows built-in PowerShell and WinRM capabilities to connect to a Windows host to acquire and export the registry as forensic evidence for further analysis. The capture can be for the entire registry or for a specific hive or path.
##### Registry Parse Data Analysis
Leverages the RegistryParse automation to perform registry analysis and extract forensic artifacts.  The automation includes common registry objects to extract which are useful for analyzing a registry, or a user provided registry path to parse.
#### Scripts
##### Etl2Pcap
Receives an ETL file and converts it to a PCAP file.
##### RegistryParse
Extracts critical forensics data from a registry file.

  1) Check if assets (IP, Domain, or Certificate) associated with the issue are excluded in the exclusions list and optionally, close the incident automatically.
  2) Optionally, enrich indicators and calculate the severity of the issue, using sub-playbooks.
  3) Optionally, allow the analyst to add associated assets (IP, Domain, or Certificate) to the exclusions list.
  4) Tag associated assets.
  5) Update the status of the issue.
