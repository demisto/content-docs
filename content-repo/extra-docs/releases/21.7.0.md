#### Layouts
- **Forensic Acquisition And Analysis**
(Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.0.0)
#### Playbooks
##### Acquire And Analyze Host Forensics
This playbook enables gathering forensic data from a host and analyzing the acquired data by using the relevant forensics automations.
##### Forensics Tools Analysis
This playbook allows the user to analyze forensic evidence acquired from a host, such as registry files and PCAP files.
##### PS-Remote Acquire Host Forensics
This playbook allows the user to gather multiple forensic data from a Windows endpoint including network traffic, MFT (Master File Table), and registry export by using the PS Remote automation which enables connecting to a Windows host without the need to install any 3rd-party tools using just native Windows management tools.
##### PS Remote Get File Sample From Path
This playbook leverages the Windows built-in PowerShell and WinRM capabilities to connect to a Windows host to acquire a file as forensic evidence for further analysis.
##### PS-Remote Get MFT
This playbook leverages the Windows built-in PowerShell and WinRM capabilities to connect to a Windows host to acquire and export the MFT (Master File Table) as forensic evidence for further analysis.
##### PS-Remote Get Network Traffic
This playbook leverages the Windows built-in PowerShell and WinRM capabilities to connect to a Windows host. It then connectst to the Netsh tool to create an ETL file which is the equivalent of a Wireshark PCAP file by using the PS-Remote integration. After receiving the resultant ETL, XSOAR will be able to convert the ETL to a PCAP file to be parsed and enriched later. Review the Microsoft documentation for how to use ETL filters (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/jj129382(v=ws.11)#using-filters-to-limit-etl-trace-file-details).
##### PS-Remote Get Registry
This playbook leverages the Windows built-in PowerShell and WinRM capabilities to connect to a Windows host to acquire and export the registry as forensic evidence for further analysis. The capture can be for the entire registry or for a specific hive or path.
##### Registry Parse Data Analysis
This playbook leverages the RegistryParse automation to perform registry analysis and extract forensic artifacts.  The automation includes common registry objects to extract which are useful for analyzing registry, or a user provides registry path to parse.
#### Scripts
##### Etl2Pcap
Receives an ETL file and converts it to a PCAP file.
##### RegistryParse
This command uses the Registry Parse automation to extract critical forensics data from a registry file. The essential values are specified by the argument.

  2) Optionally, enrich indicators and calculate the severity of the issue, using sub-playbooks.
  3) Optionally, allow the analyst to add associated assets (IP, Domain or Certificate) to the exclusions list.
  4) Tag associated assets.
  5) Update the status of the issue.
