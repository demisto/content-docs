# Cortex XSOAR Content Release Notes for version 20.8.0 (80195)
##### Published on 4 August 2020

---

Welcome to the 20.8.0 Content Release for Cortex XSOAR. Starting from the 20.6.0 release, we restructured our release notes to be based on **Content Packs**. One of our team's top priorities is making our Content more accessible and understandable for both users and contributors. In this effort, we recently moved our [Content repo](https://github.com/demisto/content) to work in Pack format, in which there is a clear separation and grouping of Content artifacts. Each Content Pack provides a clear grouping of related Content artifacts used to either implement a use case, implement an integration or provide a clear set of functionality. Our new release notes are structured around Content Packs and you will see related Content artifacts grouped together according to Packs. We hope you will find this new format useful and clear.

#### For Cortex XSOAR version 5.5 and earlier, you can still install content updates directly in the platform.

##### CrowdStrike Malquery  
Use the MalQuery Integration to query the contents of clean and malicious binary files, which forms part of Falcon's search engine.
#### Playbooks
##### CrowdStrikeMalquery - Multidownload and Fetch  
Schedule samples for download. Using samples-multidownload is a
    three-step process: 1. Schedule the download with samples-multidownload, which
    returns a request ID. 2. Provide that request ID to the cs-malquery-get-request,
    in order to check the status of the operation. 3. When the request status is
    “done”, use cs-malquery-sample-fetch to download the results as a password-protected
    archive
    Use this playbook as a sub-playbook to schedule samples for download.
    This playbook implements polling by continuously running the `get-request` command until the operation completes.
    Once the request status is done the sub-playbook runs cs-malquery-sample-fetch.

    The remote action should have the following structure:
    1. Initiate the operation - insert the sample SHA256 ids.
    2. Poll to check if the operation completed.
    3. Get the results of the operation.
##### CrowdStrikeMalquery - Search
