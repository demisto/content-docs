#### Integrations
##### Expanse v2
The Expanse v2 integration for Cortex XSOAR leverages the Expander API to create incidents from Expanse issues. It also leverages Expanse's unparalleled view of the Internet to enrich IP addresses, domains, and certificates using information from assets discovered by Expanse Expander and risky flows detected by Expanse Behavior.
##### Expanse Expander Feed
Use this feed to retrieve the discovered IP addresses, domains, and certificates from the Expanse Expander asset database.

#### Layouts
- **Expanse Certificate Indicator Layout** (from Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0)
- **Expanse Issue Layout** (from Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0)


#### Playbooks
##### Expanse Attribution
Sub-playbook for the Handle Expanse Incident playbook. Given an Expanse issue IP address, issue provider, issue domain, issue port, and issue protocol, it hunts for internal activity related to the detected service. The playbook looks for logs on Splunk, Cortex Data Lake, and Panorama. It returns a list of potential owner business units, owner users, devices, and notes.

##### Expanse Enrich Cloud Assets
Sub-playbook for the Handle Expanse Incident playbook.
It enriches public cloud assets (i.e., IP addresses and FQDNs) by:
- Searching the corresponding region and service by correlating the provided IP addresses with IP range feeds retrieved from public cloud providers. (It requires TIM and Public Cloud feeds such as AWS Feed integrations to be enabled).
- Searching IP addresses and FQDNs in the Prisma Cloud inventory (requires Prisma Cloud).
##### Expanse Find Cloud IP Address Region and Service
Sub-playbook for the Expanse Enrich Cloud Assets sub-playbook. Used to find the corresponding public cloud region (i.e., AWS us-east-1) and service (i.e., AWS EC2) for a provided IP address. It works by correlating the provided IP address with the IP range indicators (CIDRs) that can be collected from public cloud feeds (i.e., AWS Feed) in Cortex XSOAR. CIDR indicators must be tagged properly using the corresponding tags (i.e., AWS for AWS Feed). Tags can be configured in the feed integrations and must match the ones provided in the inputs of this playbook. Correlation is done based on the longest match (i.e., a smaller CIDR such as /20 range wins over a larger one such as /16).
##### Expanse Load-Create List
Sub-playbook to support the Expanse Handle Incident playbook.
Loads a list to be used in the Expanse playbook.
Creates the list if it does not exist.

##### Extract and Enrich Expanse Indicators
Sub-playbook for the Handle Expanse Incident playbook.
Extracts and enriches indicators (CIDRs, IP, Certificates, Domains, and DomainGlobs) from Expanse incidents.
Enrichment is performed via the ***enrichIndicators*** command and generic playbooks.
Returns the enriched indicators.
##### Handle Expanse Incident
Main playbook to handle Expanse incidents.

There are several phases:
1. Enrichment: All the related information from the incident is extracted and related indicators (types IP, CIDR, Domain, DomainGlob, and Certificate) are created and enriched.
2. Validation: The located IP address and FQDN are correlated with the information available in other products:
   - Risky or non-compliant communications to and from the IP address with external IP addresses as flagged in Expanse's behavior.
   - Firewall logs from Cortex Data Lake, Panorama, and Splunk.
   - User information from Active Directory.
   - Public IP address from AWS/GCP/Azure public IP feeds to identify the public cloud region and service (i.e., us-west-1 on AWS EC2).
   - IP address and FQDN from Prisma Cloud inventory
3. Shadow IT check: Based on the information found, the playbook can suggest whether the discovered issue corresponds to an asset that is known to the InfoSec team (i.e., there are firewall logs present, or the asset is protected by Prisma Cloud, or is part of an IP range associated with the company).
4. Attribution: Based on the information collected above, the analyst is prompted to assign this issue to an organization unit, that is a group within the company with a specific owner. The analyst can choose from existing organization units (stored in an XSOAR list) or define a new one.
5. Response: Depending on the issue type, several remediation actions can be automatically and manually performed, such as:
    - Tagging the asset in Expanse with a specific organization unit tag.
    - Blocking the service on PAN-OS (if a firewall is deployed in front of the service).
    - Creating a new Shadow IT issue (if the asset is detected to be Shadow IT and the analyst confirms it).
    - Adding the service to a vulnerability management system.
    - Linking the incident to a related Prisma Cloud alert for the asset (if the asset is found under Prisma Cloud inventory).
##### Handle Expanse Incident - Attribution Only
 Shorter version of Handle Expanse Incident playbook with only the Attribution part.

There are several phases:
1. Enrichment: All the related information from the incident is extracted and related indicators (types IP, CIDR, Domain, DomainGlob, and Certificate) are created and enriched.
2. Validation: The located IP address and FQDN are correlated with the information available in other products:
   - Risky or non-compliant communications to and from the IP address with external IP addresses as flagged in Expanse's behavior.
   - Firewall logs from Cortex Data Lake, Panorama, and Splunk.
   - User information from Active Directory.
   - Public IP address from AWS/GCP/Azure public IP feeds to identify the public cloud region and service (i.e., us-west-1 on AWS EC2).
   - IP address and FQDN from Prisma Cloud inventory
3. Shadow IT check: Based on the information found, the playbook can suggest whether the discovered issue corresponds to an asset that is known to the InfoSec team (i.e., there are firewall logs present, or the asset is protected by Prisma Cloud, or is part of an IP range associated with the company).
4. Attribution: Based on the information collected above, the analyst is prompted to assign this issue to an organization unit, that is a group within the company with a specific owner. The analyst can choose from existing organization units (stored in an XSOAR list) or define a new one.
