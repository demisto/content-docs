### The `xsoar_config.json` File
The configuration file that defines what will be set up on the machine.<br /> 
Consists of the following sections:
- `custom_packs` - Your own internal packs to be installed through the build process.
- `marketplace_packs` - Marketplace packs to be installed on the machine.
- `lists` - Lists to be created in the machine.
- `jobs` - Jobs to be created in the machine.

### The `Configuration Setup` Playbook
This playbook will manage the entire configuration process and needs to run through a `Configuration Setup` incident type.<br />
It consists of five stages:
1. Fetching the configuration file and loading its content to the machine.
2. Downloading and installing the custom packs.
3. Installing Marketplace packs.
4. Configuring lists.
5. Configuring jobs.

### How to use the pack
#### You can choose either to use the pack manually, or set it up to work as a scheduled job:
-To run the pack manually, you will need to create a new `Configurtaion Setup` type incident.
- To run the pack as a scheduled job, you will need to set up a new job for a `Configurtaion Setup` type incident.

#### How to configure the incident/job:
1. Choose the source of the configuration file for the playbook run:
   - Attachment - The file is already attached to the incident, and its information is located under the `File` context path.
   - GitHub - Will use the `GitHub` integration to fetch the configuration file.
2. Choose the source of the custom packs files for the playbook run:
   - Attachments - The files are already attached to the incident, and their information is located under the `File` context path.
   - Google Cloud Storage - Will use the `Google Cloud Storage` integration to download the files.
   - HTTP request - Will use the `http` script to download the files.
3. If you choose the option to use the `GitHub` integration to fetch the configuration file, you will also need to enter the information regarding its location and branch in the repo by completing the `Configuration File Path` and `Branch Name` fields.

### Recommendations for creating custom packs ready for installation
1. Validate the packs' files using the [demisto-sdk validate](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/concepts/demisto-sdk#validate) command.
2. Run unit tests and linters on the packs using the [demisto-sdk lint](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/concepts/demisto-sdk#lint) command.
3. Create uploadable pack zips using the [demisto-sdk create-content-artifacts](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk/blob/master/demisto_sdk/commands/create_artifacts/README.md) command.

### Limitations
Currently, the pack does not support the following features:
1. Integration instances.
2. Server configuration keys.
