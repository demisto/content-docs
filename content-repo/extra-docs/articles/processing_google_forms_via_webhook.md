title: Processing Google Form Responses via a Webhook
description: Connecting Google Forms with Cortex XSOAR.
---

Imagine you have a Google form for some purpose, and you want to run some logic with different services upon form submission.
As you might know, Google provides an IDE to run some code that is bounded to the form. This service is called [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script).
But combining various kinds of services can be frustrating. You can use Cortex XSOAR to make this process a lot easier.

For instance, see the following architecture:

<img src="../../../docs/doc_imgs/reference/google-forms-cortex-xsoar.png" width="700"></img>

## Implementation Flow

### Generic Webhook Configuration

1. Download the [Generic Webhook Pack](https://xsoar.pan.dev/marketplace/details/GenericWebhook) and configure an instance of the [Generic Webhook Integration](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/generic-webhook). For example, you can call the instance: *GenericWebhookForm*.

   :::note NOTE
   The webhook integration needs to be accessible from the internet. See the following article on how to access the Webhook via [Server's HTTPS Endpoint](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/articles/long-running-invoke). If your Server is not accessible, you may need to run the Webhook integration on an engine which is accessible from the internet.
   :::

2. Please configure the Webhook integration with a username & password, as the attached code is using basic authentication. See the [Integration documentation](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/generic-webhook) for more information.

3. In Cortex XSOAR, create an incident type that represents the Google Form use case. Add a layout, mapper, classifier, etc...

   It is recommended to enable the **store_samples** parameter of the Webhook integration to be able to create a mapper. Example of a mapper configuration:
   
   <img src="../../../docs/doc_imgs/reference/google-forms-mapping.png" width="700"></img>

4. Create a designated playbook to run when the incident is created. 

### Google Forms Configuration

1. Create a Google form that will provide the information you need.

2. Create a Google Apps Script for the selected form. See [Creating a project from Google Docs, Sheets, or Forms](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/projects#creating_a_project_from_google_docs_sheets_or_forms) for more information.

3. Add the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request` scope to your **appsscript.json** file. See [this](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/concepts/scopes) for more information.

4. Create a new file in the script editor with the following generic code. (Replace the username, password, and URL with the values from the Generic Webhook integration):
    ```javascript
      function atFormSubmit(e) {
        var formResponse = e.response;
        var itemResponses = formResponse.getItemResponses();
        var formData = {};
        for (var i = 0; i < itemResponses.length; i++) {
          var itemResponse = itemResponses[i];
          var key = itemResponse.getItem().getTitle();
          var value = itemResponse.getResponse();
          formData[key] = value;
          Logger.log('Response to the question "%s" was "%s"', key, value);
        }
        sendPostRequestToXSOAR(formData);
      }
      function sendPostRequestToXSOAR(formData) {
        var body = {name: "New Google Forms Response", raw_json: formData};
        var username = <YOUR_USERNAME>;
        var password = <YOUR_PASSWORD>;
        var url = <YOUR_WEBHOOK_INSTANCE_URL>;
        var params = {
          method: "POST",
          payload: JSON.stringify(body),
          validateHttpsCertificates: false,
          muteHttpExceptions: true,
          contentType: "application/json",
          headers: {"Authorization": "Basic " + Utilities.base64Encode(username + ":" + password)}
        };
        var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, params);
        Logger.log('Response code "%s": ', response.getResponseCode());
        Logger.log('Response content "%s": ', response.getContentText());
      }
    ```

5. Add an [on Submit trigger](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers) to the context of the form and choose the *atFormSubmit* function to run when the form is submitted.
   <img src="../../../docs/doc_imgs/reference/google-apps-script-trigger.png" width="800"></img>
6. You can debug your work in the [Executions Feature](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/v8-runtime?hl=en#view_executions).
   <img src="../../../docs/doc_imgs/reference/google-apps-script-executions.png" width="800"></img>

That's it, now every form submission will be reflected and managed by your playbook in Cortex XSOAR.
