description: Common troubleshooting steps for automations and integrations.

This guide provides common troubleshooting steps. When reporting an issue to Cortex XSOAR Support, always include all information obtained from running the following troubleshooting steps.

## Network Troubleshooting

Examples of common errors indicating that there probably is a networking issue:
* `[Errno -2] Name does not resolve`
* `[Errno 110] Operation timed out`
* `Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -3] Try again`
* `dial tcp: lookup ****: no such host`
* `connect: operation timed out`
* `connect: connection refused`


When troubleshooting networking issues, it is important to first understand what type of networking the integration or automation is using. Cortex XSOAR integrations and automations can be classified into two main types regarding their networking use:

### Host Based Networking 
Integrations/automations running within the Server/Engine will use the networking stack provided by the host machine of the Server/Engine. Such integrations/automations include native integrations (part of the Server binary) such as the `RemoteAccess` integration and JavaScript integrations such as `VirusTotal` and `http`. Native Integrations can be identified by the fact that they are shipped as part of the Server and not associated to a Content Pack. JavaScript integrations/automations can be identified by inspecting the integration/automation settings and under *Language Type* will appear **JavaScript**. JavaScript integrations/automations run within the Cortex XSOAR Server/Engine process using a JavaScript virtual environment and thus use the same network stack as the Server/Engine. The source IPs for these integrations/automations will be the same as used by the Server/Engine.


If the integration/automation is using HTTP based communication we recommend testing as a first step locally via the `curl` utility if it is possible to perform network communication with the HTTP endpoint. Run the `curl` command on the Server or Engine machine by logging in via SSH. Common `curl` command variants (`httpbin.org` is used as an example url):
```bash
# Run simple curl command with -v for verbose output:
curl -v https://httpbin.org/status/200

# Run with -k to trust any certificate in case you receive errors regarding certificates
curl -vk https://httpbin.org/status/200

# curl will use the machine env variables for proxy settings. If you wish to ignore the proxy settings run:
curl -vk --noproxy "*" https://httpbin.org/status/200

# Setting explicitly a proxy server to use by curl
curl -x http://192.168.0.1:8080 https://httpbin.org/status/200

# Passing an additional header as part of the curl request:
curl -v -H 'Accept: application/json' https://httpbin.org/headers

# In cases that the integration uses basic authentication, you can also easily test the credentials:
curl -v --user myuser:mypass https://httpbin.org//basic-auth/myuser/mypass
```

More info about `curl` is available at [Everything curl](https://ec.haxx.se/).

If you are not able to perform a basic `curl` request from the machine to the target HTTP endpoint, the issue is probably not a problem with the integration/automation but rather with the networking setup of the Server/Engine machine. Make sure to first resolve the networking issue so a basic `curl` command succeeds before continuing to test the integration/automation. Many times this resolves to a firewall, NAT or proxy issue. 

### Docker Based Networking
Docker Based integrations/automations are written in Python or Powershell. They can be identified by inspecting the integration/automation settings and under *Language type* will appear **Python** or **Powershell**. Docker creates its own networking, thus the integrations/automations are using a different networking stack from the Cortex XSOAR Server/Engine. The source IPs for these integrations/automations are different and provided according to the Docker networking configuration.

As with [Host Based Networking](#host-based-networking), for integrations/automations that use HTTP endpoints we recommend testing as a first step with `curl` from within a docker container. This can be done by logging in to the Server/Engine machine via SSH and running the following command:
```bash
docker run -it --rm demisto/netutils:1.0.0.6138 curl <curl parameters>
```
For example:
```bash
# Run simple curl command with -v for verbose output:
docker run -it --rm demisto/netutils:1.0.0.6138 curl -v https://httpbin.org/status/200
```
For additional `curl` sample commands see the [Host Based Networking](#host-based-networking) section.

**Note**: You may need to run `docker` with `sudo` or login with root if your user doesn't have sufficient permissions to execute the `docker` command.

If running `curl` from within `docker` fails with networking errors, we recommend also verifying if the `curl` command succeeds or fails without `docker` by running the `curl` command directly on the host machine. If the `curl` command succeeds on the host machine and fails within docker, you are probably experiencing a Docker networking issue regarding how the Docker networking stack is configured. 

It is recommended that you use the Docker networking stack because it provides networking isolation. Our recommendation is to try to resolve the [Docker networking issue](https://success.docker.com/article/troubleshooting-container-networking) and consult the [Docker networking docs](https://docs.docker.com/network/). 

For cases that running with Docker's networking stack continues to cause issues, there is an option to run Docker containers with host networking. In this mode, the container will share the host’s network stack and all interfaces from the host will be available to the container. The container’s host name will match the hostname on the host system. You can test this mode by running a `curl` command via `docker` in the following form:
```bash
docker run -it --rm --network=host demisto/netutils:1.0.0.6138 curl -v https://httpbin.org/status/200
```

If running with `--network=host` succeeds, you can configure the Server to use host networking for docker by adding the following advanced server configuration in Cortex XSOAR:

Key | Value
--- |  ----
`python.pass.extra.keys` | `--network=host`

**Notes:**
* For multi-tenant deployments, you need to add this setting to each tenant.
* When using engines, you need to add this setting to each engine.
