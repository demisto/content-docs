title: Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR - Investigation and Response
description: Automates Cortex XDR incident response, and includes custom Cortex XDR incident views and layouts to aid analyst investigations.
---
The Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR - Investigation and Response pack automates Cortex XDR incident response, and includes custom Cortex XDR incident views and layouts to aid analyst investigations.

Cortex XDR is a detection and response app that natively integrates network, endpoint, and cloud data to stop sophisticated attacks. 

Responding and managing these attacks requires security teams to reconcile data from multiple sources. Valuable time is lost shuttling between screens and executing repeatable tasks while an attack continues to manifest. 

The playbooks included in this pack help you save time and keep your incidents in sync with Cortex XDR. They also help automate repetitive tasks associated with Cortex XDR incidents:
- Syncs and updates Cortex XDR incidents.
- Triggers a sub-playbook to handle each alert by type.
- Extracts and enriches all relevant indicators from the source alert.
- Hunts for related IOCs.
- Calculates the severity of the incident.
- Interacts with the analyst to choose a remediation path or close the incident as a false positive based on the gathered information and incident severity.
- Remediates the incident by blocking malicious indicators and isolating infected endpoints.

The Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR - Investigation and Response pack enables the following flows: 
- [Device Control Violations](#device-control-violations) - Fetch device control violations from XDR and communicate with the user to determine the reason the device was connected.
- [XDR Incident Handling](#xdr-incident-handling) - Compare incidents in Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR and Cortex XSOAR, and update the incidents appropriately. 

 

## Device Control Violations
If a user connects an unauthorized device to the corporate network, such as a USB dongle or a portable hard disk drive, the connection creates an event in Cortex XDR. 
The [Cortex XDR device control violations](#cortex-xdr-device-control-violations) playbook queries Cortex XDR for device control violations for specified hosts, IP addresses, or XDR endpoint IDs. It then communicates via email with the involved users to understand the nature of the incident and if the user connected the device. 

The playbook can enrich data for XDR incidents and determine if there were any device control violations prior to this incident or if there is a correlation between this incident and another one. 

You can create a job to periodically query Cortex XDR for device control violations. The dedicated [JOB - Cortex XDR query endpoint device control violations](#job---cortex-xdr-query-endpoint-device-control-violations) playbook enriches the data associated with the endpoint device control events, and creates an incident if any violations are found.  The [Cortex XDR device control violations](#cortex-xdr-device-control-violations) playbook is the response playbook for the violations found.

The [Cortex XDR device control violations](#cortex-xdr-device-control-violations) playbook can be used to enrich data for the involved hosts/users in XDR and other incidents.

All collected data is displayed in the XDR device control incident layout.



### XDR Incident Handling

The [Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR - Investigation and Response](#palo-alto-networks-cortex-XDR---investigation-and-response) integration fetches Cortex XDR incidents and runs the [Cortex XDR incident handling v3](#cortex-xdr-incident-handling-v3) playbook. The playbook runs the ***xdr-get-incident-extra-data*** command to retrieve data fields of the specific incident including a list of alerts with multiple events, alerts, and key artifacts.  

The playbook then searches for similar incidents in Cortex XSOAR to link to the current incident. If a similar incident is found, the analyst will be asked whether to close the current incident as a duplicate since there is an older incident already being handled. The analyst will review the linked incident and decide if the incident should be resolved and closed as a duplicate incident. 

If no similar incidents are found, or if the analyst does not want to close the incident as a duplicate, the workflow continues.

The [Cortex XDR Alerts Handling](#cortex-xdr-alerts-handling) sub-playbook loops through and checks the category of the alerts. Currently, this sub-playbook handles Malware and Port Scan alerts only. If the category is Malware, the [Cortex XDR - Malware Investigation](#cortex-xdr---malware-investigation) sub-playbook will run. If the category is Port Scan, the [Cortex XDR - Port Scan - Adjusted](#cortex-xdr---port-scan---adjusted) sub-playbook will run. After the Malware or Port Scan sub-playbook runs or if the alert is in any other category, the main playbook will continue to further investigate. It counts the number of alerts in the incident. This information will be displayed in the layout. It then executes the [Cortex XDR device control violations](#cortex-xdr-device-control-violations) sub-playbook. 

Then the [Entity Enrichment Generic v3](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/entity-enrichment---generic-v3) sub-playbook runs which takes all the entities in the incidents and enriches them with the available products in the environment. The SOC team will then do a manual in-depth analysis of the incident. 

You can then choose to optionally run the [Palo Alto Networks - Hunting And Threat Detection](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/palo-alto-networks---hunting-and-threat-detection) sub-playbook to extract IOCs from the investigation and run them across the organization to check if there are any other compromised accounts or endpoints with the same information that was detected in this alert.

The severity of the incident is calculated by the [Calculate Severity - Generic v2](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/calculate-severity---generic-v2) sub-playbook.

Based on the severity, the analyst decides whether to continue to the remediation stage or close the investigation as a false positive. The remediation blocks all the indicators that were extracted from the incident either manually or automatically using the [Block Indicators - Generic v2](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/block-indicators---generic-v2) sub-playbook.

If this was a port scan alert, the analyst will manually block the ports used for the exploitation on the scanned hosts.

After the remediation, if there are no new alerts, the playbook stops the alert sync and closes the XDR incident and investigation. 

### Syn Indicators between Cortex XSOAR and Cortex XDR
The [Cortex XDR - IOCs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/cortex-xdr---ioc) feed integration syncs indicators between Cortex XSOAR and Cortex XDR. The integration syncs indicators according to the defined fetch interval. At each interval, the integration pushes new and modified indicators defined in the Sync Query from Cortex XSOAR to Cortex XDR. Additionally, the integration checks if there are manual modifications of indicators on Cortex XDR and syncs back to Cortex XSOAR. Once per day, the integration performs a complete sync which also removes indicators that have been deleted or expired in Cortex XSOAR, from Cortex XDR.
 


## In This Pack
The Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR - Investigation and Response content pack includes several content items.

### Automations
- **EntryWidgetNumberHostsXDR**: Entry widget that returns the number of hosts in a Cortex XDR incident. 
- **EntryWidgetNumberUsersXDR**: Entry widget that returns the number of users that participated in a specified Cortex XDR incident.
- **EntryWidgetPieAlertsXDR**: Entry widget that returns a pie chart of alerts for a specified Cortex XDR incident by alert severity (low, medium, and high).
- **XDRSyncScript**: Deprecated. The incoming and outgoing mirroring feature added in XSOAR version 6.0.0 is used instead to sync XDR. After the Calculate Severity - Generic v2 sub-playbookâ€™s run, Cortex XSOAR will be treated as the single source of truth for the severity field, and it will sync only from Cortex XSOAR to XDR, so manual changes for the severity field in XDR will not update in the XSOAR incident.

### Classifiers
- **Cortex XDR - Classifier**: Classifies Cortex XDR incidents.

The report will be sent to email addresses provided in the playbook input.
The playbook includes an incident type with a dedicated layout to visualize the collected data.


#### [Cortex XDR Incident Handling](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/cortex-xdr-incident-handling)
This playbook is triggered by fetching a Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR incident. 
Syncs and updates new XDR alerts that construct the incident. It enriches indicators using Threat Intelligence integrations and Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus. The incident's severity is then updated based on the indicators' reputation and an analyst is assigned for manual investigation. If chosen, automated remediation with Palo Alto Networks FireWall is initiated. After a manual review by the SOC analyst, the XDR incident is closed automatically.

***Note*** - The **XDRSyncScript** used by this playbook sets data in the XDR incident fields that were released to content from the Cortex XSOAR server version 5.0.0. For Cortex XSOAR versions under 5.0.0, follow the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR documentation to upload the new fields manually.

#### [Cortex XDR incident handling v2](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/cortex-xdr-incident-handling-v2)
This playbook is triggered by fetching a Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR incident.
The playbook syncs and updates new XDR alerts that construct the incident and triggers a sub-playbook to handle each alert by type.
Then, the playbook performs enrichment on the incident's indicators and hunting for related IOCs.
Based on the severity, it lets the analyst decide whether to continue to the remediation stage or close the investigation as a false positive. 
After the remediation, if there are no new alerts, the playbook stops the alert sync and closes the XDR incident and investigation.

#### [Cortex XDR incident handling v3](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/cortex-xdr-incident-handling-v3)
This playbook is triggered by fetching a Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR incident.
The playbook syncs and updates new XDR alerts that construct the incident and triggers a sub-playbook to handle each alert by type.
Then, the playbook performs enrichment on the incidentâ€™s indicators and hunts for related IOCs.
Based on the severity, it lets the analyst decide whether to continue to the remediation stage or close the investigation as a false positive.
After the remediation, if there are no new alerts, the playbook stops the alert sync and closes the XDR incident and investigation. For performing the bidirectional sync, the playbook uses the incoming and outgoing mirroring feature added in XSOAR version 6.0.0. After the Calculate Severity - Generic v2 sub-playbookâ€™s run, Cortex XSOAR will be treated as the single source of truth for the severity field, and it will sync only from Cortex XSOAR to XDR, so manual changes for the severity field in XDR will not update in the XSOAR incident.

#### [Cortex XDR Incident Sync](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/cortex-xdr-incident-sync)
Compares incidents in Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR and Cortex XSOAR, and updates the incidents appropriately. When an incident is updated in Cortex XSOAR, the XDRSyncScript will update the incident in XDR. When an incident is updated in XDR, the XDRSyncScript will update the incident fields in Cortex XSOAR and rerun the current playbook. Do not use this playbook when enabling the incident mirroring feature added in XSOAR version 6.0.0.


#### [Cortex XDR - Block File](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/cortex-xdr---block-file)
Adds files to the Cortex XDR block list with a given file SHA256 playbook input.
