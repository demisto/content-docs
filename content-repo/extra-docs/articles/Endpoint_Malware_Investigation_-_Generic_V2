title: Endpoint Malware Investigation - Generic V2
description: The Endpoint Malware Investigation content pack provides a framework for handling malware investigations.
---
 

The **Endpoint Malware Investigation** content pack provides a generic framework to handle malware investigation. This pack incorporates the most relevant integrations in Cortex XSOAR for handling malware incidents.

The new feature in **Endpoint Malware Investigation - Generic V2** (available from version 6.1) is the indicators extraction rules. This feature extracts all the relevant fields from incidents in order to run the **Endpoint Malware Investigation - Generic V2** playbook properly.

## Pack Workflow

First you need to decide in which incidents to activate the Malware incident type. If you don't have a default playbook or incident type for your endpoint protection integration, this pack could be a good fit. You just need to define the malware incident type for the relevant integration or create a dedicated [Classifier](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/incidents/incident-classification-mapping#classification).
 

 
## What's in this Content Pack?     
### Playbooks
There is 1 playbook in this pack.

**Endpoint Malware Investigation - Generic V2** 

This playbook provides a framework for handling a malware investigation through all essential stages. The playbook consists of the following stages where each stage contains the relevant playbook or tasks. 

#### Enrichment
The **Endpoint Enrichment - Generic v2.1** playbook provides the first essential details on the involved hosts in the incident.

For additional information, refer to: [Endpoint Enrichment - Generic v2.1](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/endpoint-enrichment---generic-v21)

The **File Enrichment - Generic v2** playbook provides a preliminary verdict for the suspicious file.

For additional information, refer to:
[File Enrichment - Generic v2](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/file-enrichment---generic-v2)


#### Retrieve File

The **Retrieve File from Endpoint - Generic V2** playbook retrieves the required file for further investigation. This playbook can retrieve a file by its hash or by its file path. 


For additional information, refer to: [Retrieve File from Endpoint - Generic V2](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/retrieve-file-from-endpoint---generic-v2)


#### Detonation

Dynamic analysis for suspicious files is a significant stage in every malware incident. The analysis will not only determine if the file is malicious, but also provide indicators for further investigation.
The **Detonate File - Generic** playbook detonates files through active integrations that support file detonation.




For additional information, refer to: [Detonate File - Generic](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/detonate-file---generic)


#### Forensics

The **Forensics - Generic** playbook provides additional forensics on the investigated host. Currently, this playbook uses only the Illusive network integration.

For additional information, refer to:
**LINK**


#### Threat Hunting

The **Threat Hunting - Generic** playbook assists in hunting IOCs in your organization as part of the malware investigation.


For additional information, refer to:
**LINK**

#### Isolation

The **Isolate Endpoint - Generic** playbook rapidly isolates the infected host and prevents the threat from spreading throughout your organization. 

For additional information, refer to: [Isolate Endpoint - Generic](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/isolate-endpoint---generic).

#### Unisolation

The **Unisolate Endpoint - Generic** playbook unisolates endpoints according to the endpoint ID or hostname that is provided by the playbook input.

For additional information, refer to:
**LINK**

#### Remediation and Blocking Indicators

The **Block Indicators - Generic v2** playbook blocks the malicious indicators that were discovered during the investigation. The playbook blocks files, IPs, URLs, and user accounts.




For additional information, refer to: [Block Indicators - Generic v2](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/block-indicators---generic-v2)

## Auto Extract 
(https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/incidents/incident-auto-extract)

In the 6.1 version a new future was added to XSOAR. The Auto Extract from incidents fields feature extracts indicators from incidents fields and enriches their reputations using commands and scripts defined for the indicator type. You can automatically extract indicators in the following scenarios:
- When fetching incidents
- In a playbook task
- Using the command line


In order for the malware incident type layout to properly display the relevant fields and for the playbook to extract the fields it is important to map the fields as shown in the table below so that they will appear in the malware incident layout.

Refer to the [incident classification and mapping](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/incidents/incident-classification-mapping) documentation for relevant guidance.

Fields that will not be mapped will not appear in the layout under the section below.


                                       

| File Attributes | Source Details |
| --------- | ------------- | 
| File Name | Src | 
| File Path | Host Name |
| File Hash | MAC Address | 
| MD5 | Src NT Domain | 
|  SHA1 | Src OS | 
| SHA256 | Agent ID | 
| File Size | Isolated | 
| Signature | | 



In the **Endpoint Malware Investigation - Generic V2** playbook, the indicators are extracted according to the indicators extraction rules of the malware incident type.


To view the indicators that will be extracted:
1. Navigate to **Settings** >  **Advanced** > **Incidents Types**.
2. Mark the *Malware* checkbox.
3. Click **Indicator Extraction Rules**.

![Rules](../../../docs/doc_imgs/reference/Endpoint_Malware_Investigation_-_Generic_V2/Indicators_extraction_rules.png) 
      
If you want to edit the indicator extraction rules, you need to detach the Malware incident type. When you finish editing the rules, you must reattach the Malware incident type.
1. Navigate to **Settings** >  **Advanced** > **Incidents Types**.
2. Mark the *Malware* checkbox.
4. Click **Detach**.

![detach](../../../docs/doc_imgs/reference/Endpoint_Malware_Investigation_-_Generic_V2/Incident_type_settings.png) 

2. Mark the *Malware* checkbox.
3. Click **Indicator Extraction Rules**.
5. Edit the rules.
6. When you are finished editing, click **Save**.
7. Mark the *Malware* checkbox.
8. Click **Reattach**.

Note: Reattaching the incident type enables getting updates for the incident type. If you reattach the incident type, the next update will override any changes you made to the default playbook and indicator extraction rules.
