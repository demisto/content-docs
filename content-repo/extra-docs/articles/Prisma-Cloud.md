## Pack Description
Automate and unify security incident response across your cloud environments, while still giving a degree of control to dedicated cloud teams.
Cloud adoption has expanded the threat surface and created disparate ecosystems that hamper visibility into security vulnerabilities across the network.
In addition, cloud provisioning is often managed by multiple teams, making it hard for security teams to keep pace.
The pack includes playbooks that automate Prisma Cloud alert response and custom incident fields, views and layouts to facilitate analyst investigation.
The remediation playbooks orchestrate across multiple native cloud integrations (AWS, GCP, Azure) to automate actions like changing policies, revoking access, creating new rules etc.
With this content pack, you can significantly reduce the time your Security Analysts/Cloud Operations team spend on Cloud Security alerts and standardize the way you manage misconfiguration incidents.

## What does this pack do?
The playbooks included in this Pack help automate the remediation of alerts generated from the Prisma Cloud platform.
- Take action on, remediate, and resolve incidents/ alerts from Prisma Cloud.
- Track configuration issues across all your Cloud environments.
- Ensure your Cloud environments are compliant and up to date with the latest compliance standards.
- Configure your Cloud environments using industry best practices.
As part of this pack, you will also get out-of-the-box Prisma Cloud incident views, segregated alert layouts and playbooks.
All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization.

## Before You Start
As a part of the Prisma Cloud pack, we have created Out of the Box classification and Mapping, to create incidents for all the Prisma Cloud policies that are supported and remediated through this pack.
The classified and remediated policies are as following:
  

|Policy ID | Incident Type| Policy Name| Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| All |	Prisma CloudPrisma Cloud |	- |	This is the generic incident type for this pack. All incidents that are created through the Prisma Cloud integration and don't have a specific supported incident type yet, will get classified and mapped to this incident type. |

| 7a506ab4-d0a2-48ee-a6f5-75a97f11397d |	Azure Storage Misconfiguration |	Azure storage accounts has blob container(s) with public access |	"Public access level' allows you to grant anonymous/public read access to a container and the blobs within Azure blob storage. By doing so, you can grant read-only access to these resources without sharing your account key, and without requiring a shared access signature. This policy identifies blob containers within an Azure storage account that allow anonymous/public access ('CONTAINER' or 'BLOB'). As a best practice, do not allow anonymous/public access to blob containers unless you have a very good reason. Instead, you should consider using a shared access signature token for providing controlled and time-limited access to blob containers. |"
| bc4e467f-10fa-471e-aa9b-28981dc73e93 |	Azure Storage Misconfiguration |	Storage Accounts without Secure transfer enabled |	The secure transfer option enhances the security of your storage account by only allowing requests to the storage account by a secure connection. For example, when calling REST APIs to access your storage accounts, you must connect using HTTPs. Any requests using HTTP will be rejected when 'secure transfer required' is enabled. When you are using the Azure files service, connection without encryption will fail, including scenarios using SMB 2.1, SMB 3.0 without encryption, and some flavors of the Linux SMB client. Because Azure storage doesn’t support HTTPs for custom domain names, this option is not applied when using a custom domain name. |
| 10bc76ee-6f29-4c04-98bb-b9f8bafb0964 |	GCP Compute Engine Misconfiguration |	VM Instances without any Custom metadata information |	VM instance does not have any Custom metadata. Custom metadata can be used for easy identification and searches. |
| 72b422c8-bef1-4842-a6c6-7230bf0b3492 |	GCP Compute Engine Misconfiguration |	GCP VM instances have block project-wide SSH keys feature disabled |	This policy identifies VM instances which have block project-wide SSH keys feature disabled. Project-wide SSH keys are stored in Compute/Project-metadata. Project-wide SSH keys can be used to login into all the instances within a project. Using project-wide SSH keys eases the SSH key management but if compromised, poses the security risk which can impact all the instances within a project. It is recommended to use Instance specific SSH keys which can limit the attack surface if the SSH keys are compromised. |
| 6e125379-081e-4b06-a7ba-f04da2f0901a |	GCP Kubernetes Engine Misconfiguration |	GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters Basic Authentication is set to Enabled |	This policy identifies Kubernetes Engine Clusters which have enabled Basic authentication. Basic authentication allows a user to authenticate to the cluster with a username and password. Disabling Basic authentication will prevent attacks like brute force. Authenticate using client certificate or IAM. |
| f57baa2a-6039-4a17-94e8-0be723bcdc75 |	GCP Kubernetes Engine Misconfiguration |	GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters have Legacy Authorization enabled |	This policy identifies GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters which have enabled legacy authorizer. The legacy authorizer in Kubernetes Engine grants broad and statically defined permissions to all cluster users. After legacy authorizer setting is disabled, RBAC can limit permissions for authorized users based on need. |
| e1b70bb4-bb77-4326-93d5-5dd9c5170d3f |	GCP Kubernetes Engine Misconfiguration |	GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters have Master authorized networks disabled |	This policy identifies Kubernetes Engine Clusters which have disabled Master authorized networks. Enabling Master authorized networks will let the Kubernetes Engine block untrusted non-GCP source IPs from accessing the Kubernetes master through HTTPS. |
| 6ddbfdfe-3936-43d0-8157-97a7899beae6 |	GCP Kubernetes Engine Misconfiguration |	GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters have Network policy disabled |	This policy identifies Kubernetes Engine Clusters which have disabled Network policy. A network policy defines how groups of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. By enabling network policy in a namespace for a pod, it will reject any connections that are not allowed by the network policy. |
| 53793c32-dd41-430f-bbea-2f002ddafe42 |	GCP Kubernetes Engine Misconfiguration |	GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters have Stackdriver Logging disabled |	This policy identifies Kubernetes Engine Clusters which have disabled Stackdriver Logging. Enabling Stackdriver Logging will let the Kubernetes Engine to collect, process, and store your container and system logs in a dedicated persistent data store. |
| ca4b4654-d36a-4b17-a055-9c5063fa2f41 |	GCP Kubernetes Engine Misconfiguration |	GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters have Stackdriver Monitoring disabled |	This policy identifies Kubernetes Engine Clusters which have disabled Stackdriver monitoring. Enabling Stackdriver monitoring will let the Kubernetes Engine to monitor signals and build operations in the clusters. |
| fe81b03a-c602-4b16-8ae9-973724c1adae |	GCP Kubernetes Engine Misconfiguration |	GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters web UI/Dashboard is set to Enabled |	This policy identifies Kubernetes Engine Clusters which have enabled Kubernetes web UI/Dashboard. Since all the data is being transmitted over HTTP protocol, disabling Kubernetes web UI/Dashboard will protect the data from sniffers on the same network. |
| a3688f2e-eb5b-4b8d-b26f-90d40f08fd84 |	GCP Kubernetes Engine Misconfiguration |	GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters have HTTP load balancing disabled |	This policy identifies GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters which have disabled HTTP load balancing. HTTP/HTTPS load balancing provides global load balancing for HTTP/HTTPS requests destined for your instances. Enabling HTTP/HTTPS load balancers will let the Kubernetes Engine to terminate unauthorized HTTP/HTTPS requests and make better context-aware load balancing decisions. |
| 50d5ec3b-1710-4ff7-bb09-061c30deef96 |	GCP Kubernetes Engine Misconfiguration |	GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters have binary authorization disabled |	This policy identifies Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters that have disabled binary authorization. Binary authorization is a security control that ensures only trusted container images are deployed on GKE clusters. As a best practice, verify images prior to deployment to reduce the risk of running unintended or malicious code in your environment. |
| bee0893d-85fb-403f-9ba7-a5269a46d382 |	GCP Kubernetes Engine Misconfiguration |	GCP Kubernetes cluster intra-node visibility disabled |	"With Intranode Visibility, all network traffic in your cluster is seen by the Google Cloud Platform network. This means you can see flow logs for all traffic between Pods, including traffic between Pods on the same node. And you can create firewall rules that apply to all traffic between Pods. This policy checks your cluster's intra-node visibility feature and generates an alert if it's disabled. |"
