The Expanse Content Pack for Cortex XSOAR provides full coverage of the Expander and Behavior product capabilities from Expanse to allow SOCs to automate the defense of their company’s attack surface. 

The integrations in this pack enable fetching and mirroring of Expanse issues into Cortex XSOAR incidents, and ingestion of indicators (IPs, domains, and certificates) that refer to the corporate network perimeter as discovered by Expanse.

Through a powerful set of playbooks, analysts can correlate the discovered information with data provided from internal security systems (such as Palo Alto Networks Cortex Data Lake, Prisma Cloud and Panorama, Active Directory, Splunk SIEM, etc.) to help pinpoint the correct owners of the assets and automate remediation.



## Handle Expanse Incident

After configuring an instance of the Expanse v2 integration, the Expanse issues will start getting mapped to Expanse incident type and the **Handle Expanse Incident** playbook will automatically be launched.
If you are only interested in enrichment and attribution, use the **Handle Expanse Incident - Attribution Only** playbook instead, by assigning it to the Expanse Issue Incident Type.

The first phase of the playbook is the *Enrichment* phase. The playbook tries to enrich the data (such as IP addresses, Domains, Certificates) associated with this incident. The playbook uses the enrichment commands for these indicator types to obtain as much context as possible from the Expanse integration and from other integrations that can provide reputation and enrichment for those assets.


The next phase is the *Validation* phase. This phase collects information to determine:
- If the asset is protected by the company's security services by having a firewall in front of it, if it is part of Prisma Cloud, and if it is a public cloud asset. 
- The users or owners who connect to it in order to determine who owns the asset.

This is achieved by correlating the IP address and FQDN that are found with the information available in other products as follows:
- Use Expanse's Behavior product to determine if there is risky or non-compliant communications to and from the IP address with external IP addresses.
- Search firewall logs from Cortex Data Lake, Panorama, and Splunk to see if there is evidence of that asset, if users are connected to that service, or if there a firewall protecting this service. 
- Search Prisma Cloud to see if the asset is running on a public cloud service like AWS/GCP/Azure. If it is, then the asset is protected by Prisma Cloud and the owner, IP address, and FQDN can be retrieved from the Prisma Cloud inventory.
- If a user is found from the firewall logs, the playbook enriches the user information from Active Directory.

A report is then generated and appears in the Evidence Board with all of the captured information. 

![Report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/master/Packs/ExpanseV2/doc_files/Expanse_Attribution_Report.png)

In the *Shadow IT check* phase, based on the information in the report, the playbook can suggest whether the discovered issue corresponds to an asset that is known to the InfoSec team (i.e., if there are firewall logs present, if the asset is protected by Prisma Cloud, or if it is part of an IP range associated to the company). If there is no evidence that the asset is protected by the organization, the asset is shown as a possible Shadow IT. 

In the *Attribution* phase, the analyst is prompted to assign this issue to an organization unit, which is a group within Palo Alto Networks with a specific owner. The analyst can choose from existing organization units (stored in an XSOAR list) or define a new organization unit.  

The final phase is the *Response* phase. Depending on the issue type, several remediation actions are automatically and manually performed.
- Tag the asset in Expanse with a specific organization unit tag (for example: xsoar-ou-marketing).
- Create a firewall rule that blocks the service on PAN-OS (if a Firewall is deployed in front of the service).
- Create a new Shadow IT issue (if the asset is detected to be Shadow IT and the analyst confirms it).
- Add the service to a vulnerability management system.
- Link the incident to a related Prisma Cloud alert for the asset (if the asset is found in the Prisma Cloud inventory).
- Notify the owner of the assigned organization unit.

### Playbooks
There are 7 playbooks in this pack.

#### Expanse Attribution
Sub-playbook for Handle Expanse Incident playbooks. Given an Expanse Issue IP, Issue Provider, Issue Domain, Issue Port and Issue Protocol, hunts for internal activity related to the detected service. The playbook looks for logs on Splunk, Cortex Data Lake and Panorama. Returns a list of potential owner business units, owner users, devices, and notes. 
#### Expanse Enrich Cloud Assets
Sub-playbook for Handle Expanse Incident playbooks. This playbook is meant to be used as a sub-playbook to enrich Public Cloud Assets (i.e., IP addresses and FQDNs) by:
- Searching the corresponding Region and Service by correlating the provided IPs with IP range feeds retrieved from Public Cloud Providers (require TIM and Public Cloud feeds such as AWS Feed integrations to be enabled).
- Searching IPs and FQDNs in Prisma Cloud inventory (requires Prisma Cloud). 
#### Expanse Find Cloud IP Address Region and Service
Sub-playbook for the Expanse Enrich Cloud Assets sub-playbook. This playbook is used to find the corresponding Public Cloud Region (i.e., AWS us-east-1) and Service (i.e., AWS EC2) for a provided IP address. It works by correlating the provided IP address with the IP Range Indicators (CIDRs) that can be collected from Public Cloud feeds (i.e., AWS Feed) in XSOAR. CIDR Indicators must be tagged properly using the corresponding tags (i.e., AWS for AWS Feed): tags can be configured in the Feed Integrations and must match the ones provided in the inputs of this playbook. Correlation is done based on the longest match (i.e., smaller CIDR such as /20 range wins over a bigger one such as /16).

#### Expanse Load-Create List
Sub-playbook to support the Expanse Handle Incident playbook.
- Loads a list to be used in the Expanse playbook.
- Creates the list if it does not exist.

#### Extract and Enrich Expanse Indicators
Sub-playbook for the Handle Expanse Incident playbooks.
- Extracts and enriches indicators (CIDRs, IPs, Certificates, Domains and DomainGlobs) from Expanse incidents.
- Enrichment is performed via the ***enrichIndicators*** command and generic playbooks.
- Returns the enriched indicators.

#### Handle Expanse Incident
This is the main playbook for handling Expanse incidents.


#### Handle Expanse Incident - Attribution Only
Shorter version of Handle Expanse Incident playbook with only the Attribution part.

## Pack Configurations

### Integrations
Configure an instance of the [Expanse V2](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/expanse-v2) integration. At a minimum, you only need to configure the API key. 

You do not need to enable any additional integrations, but if you don't have Panorama, Cortex Data Lake, Splunk with firewall logs, or Prisma Cloud, the enrichment and validation phases of the playbook will not provide good results.

### Playbooks

The playbooks will work with the default settings out of the box. If you want to modify any of the default setting, see [Handle Expanse Incident](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/handle-expanse-incident) for a description of the playbook inputs. 

## Troubleshooting

### Not Getting Incidents<br/>
If you are not getting incidents and there are no errors, it is most likely that there are no incidents in the configured First Fetch Time. <br/>
Try increasing the value of the First Fetch Time integration parameter. The default is 3 days.

### Errors when Running !expanse-list-risk-rules and !expanse-get-risky-flows<br/>
If you get errors when running ***!expanse-list-risk-rules*** and ***!expanse-get-risky-flows*** but not with other commands, your Expanse tenant may not be enabled with Expanse's Behavior product.<br/> Contact your Expanse customer success representative to verify if the tenant has Expanse's Behavior product.
