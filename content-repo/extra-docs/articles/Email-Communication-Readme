description: This email communications content pack enables security teams to automate the communication and notification process with end users.

---


With this Content Pack, you can use the layout as-is for email communication. It can also be in use for other incident types by adding the email communication layout to the different incident types.

## Before You Start

There are out-of-the-box classification and mapping (for EWS and Gmail) in the pack that map the incident data to custom incident fields.
Those custom incident fields must be populated with specific values for the scripts to execute.

Suppose an EWS or Gmail instance is already configured for other incident types. In that case, it’s recommended to create a new instance for the email communication type with the associated classification and mapping. 

- Ensure that you have both Mail listener and sender integrations for receiving and sending emails.


## Pack Configurations

This pack requires that you configure a pre-process rule to link between the email communications (The email response will be linked to the same incident and will not create a new one). The pre-process rule should be configured:
Conditions for Incoming Incident - for the incident type (Email Communication).
Note: If you are using Gmail instance, you should add another condition for the email labels - does not contains “SENT”
Action - to ‘Run a script‘.
Choose a script - choose the ‘PreprocessEmail’ script.
