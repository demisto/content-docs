description: This email communications content pack enables security teams to automate the communication and notification process with end-users.

With this Content Pack, you can use the layout as-is for email communication. It can also be used for new incident types by adding the email communication layout to the incident types (Example below). 
 
 
## Layout usage
There are six parts to the layout. The first three parts are responsible for creating the analyst email reply message and the others to display the original email and the full email communications and attachments. 
 
| Layout sections | Description |
|------------------ | ------------- |
| Add CC to email | Add another CC recipients to the email reply |
| Message body | Write the body of the email reply |
| Attachments | Add attachments to the email reply and the send reply button |
| Email thread | Displays the email responses |  
| Original Email HTML | Displays the original email that opened the incident |  
| Mail Attachments | Shows the metadata of the email attachments |

- To add an attachment, please make sure the ‘Show empty fields’ is clicked (enabled).
 
## Before You Start
 
There are out-of-the-box classification and mapping (for EWS and Gmail) in the pack that map the incident data to custom incident fields.
Those custom incident fields must be populated with specific values for the scripts to execute.
 
Suppose an EWS or Gmail instance is already configured for other incident types. In that case, it’s recommended to create a new instance for the email communication type with the associated classification and mapping. 
 
- Ensure that you have both Mail listener and sender integrations for receiving and sending emails.
 
The reply will be sent with the same conversation ID hence adding to the existing thread and not as separate emails per reply. 
 
 
## Pack Configurations
 
This pack requires that you configure a pre-process rule to link between the email communications (The email response will be linked to the same incident and will not create a new one). The pre-process rule should be configured:
Conditions for Incoming Incident - for the incident type (Email Communication).
Note: If you are using Gmail instance, you should add another condition for the email labels - does not contain “SENT”
Action - to ‘Run a script. ‘
Choose a script - choose the ‘PreprocessEmail’ script.
