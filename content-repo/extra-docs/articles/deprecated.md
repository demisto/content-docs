For various reasons, Content items reach a deprecated status. In most cases, the reason a content item is deprecated is that a new version replaces the deprecated content item. For Cortex XSOAR supported content items, the deprecation process involves the content item entering a **Maintenance Mode** period and finally an **End-Of-Life** declaration. Cortex XSOAR tries to make this process as seamless as possible for our customers and partners while providing visibility into what can be expected during this process.

#### Maintenance Mode
After a content item is declared deprecated, it enters a phase of maintenance mode. During this period, support and maintenance are provided for the content item. This includes bug fixes, maintenance releases, workarounds, and patches for critical bugs (whenever this is technically possible).

New features will not be added to a content item in **Maintenance Mode**. If there is a replacement or alternative version for the content item, customers are encouraged during this time period to migrate to the replacement content item. **Maintenance Mode** will usually be a period of 6 months but that period might be extended as needed. If the content item is deprecated as a result of a vendor's end-of-life of a product/service/API, the **Maintenance Mode** period might be shorter.

#### End-Of-Life
After the **Maintenance Mode** period ends, the content item will be declared **End-Of-Life**. This is the last day that the content item will be supported by Palo Alto Networks.
