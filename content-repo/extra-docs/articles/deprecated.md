description: Support dates and End of Life notices for Deprecated Integrations.

For various reasons, Integrations reach a deprecated status. In most cases, the reason an Integration is deprecated is that a new version replaces the deprecated Integration. For Cortex XSOAR supported Integrations, the deprecation process involves the Integration entering a **Maintenance Mode** period and finally an **End-Of-Life** declaration. Cortex XSOAR tries to make this process as seamless as possible for our customers and partners while providing visibility into what can be expected during this process.

#### Maintenance Mode
After an Integration is declared deprecated, it enters a phase of maintenance mode. During this period, support and maintenance are provided for the Integration. This includes bug fixes, maintenance releases, workarounds, and patches for critical bugs (whenever this is technically possible).

New features will not be added to an Integration in **Maintenance Mode**. If there is a replacement or alternative version for the Integration, customers are encouraged during this time period to migrate to the replacement Integration. **Maintenance Mode** will usually be a period of 6 months but that period might be extended as needed. If the Integration is deprecated as a result of a vendor's end-of-life of a product/service/API, the **Maintenance Mode** period might be shorter.

#### End-Of-Life
After the **Maintenance Mode** period ends, the Integration will be declared **End-Of-Life**. This is the last day that the Integration will be supported by Palo Alto Networks.
