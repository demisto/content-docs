title: Configure Server and Integrations to Trust Custom Certificates
description: Setup the Server and JS/Native Integrations to Trust Custom Certificates.

:::note
This article is relevant only for Cortex XSOAR 6 server or engines and Cortex XSOAR 8 cloud or on-prem engines.
:::

Server initiated communication (for example, downloading a pack from the Marketplace), Javascript integrations, and native integrations use the built-in set of CA-signed certificates of the host machine to validate TLS communication. If you use an engine, the engine also uses CA-signed certificates. You can add custom trusted certificates to the host built-in set.
For Python Docker integrations, you need to create a certificate file that includes the custom certificates and configure Cortex XSOAR to use it. For more information for configuring Cortex XSOAR 6, see [Configure Python Docker Integrations to Trust Custom Certificates](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XSOAR/6.12/Cortex-XSOAR-Administrator-Guide/Configure-Python-Docker-Integrations-to-Trust-Custom-Certificates). For more information for configuring Cortex XSOAR 8 cloud see [Configure Docker Integrations to Trust Custom Certificates](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XSOAR/8/Cortex-XSOAR-Administrator-Guide/Configure-Docker-Integrations-to-Trust-Custom-Certificates).
 
1. Add the certificate to the machineâ€™s trusted ROOT CA Bundle. The location of the CA Bundle depends on the version of the operating system and the operating configuration.
  Examples of certificate bundle paths:  

  "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt", // Debian/Ubuntu/Gentoo etc.  
  "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt", // Fedora/RHEL 6  
  "/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem", // OpenSUSE  
  "/etc/pki/tls/cacert.pem", // OpenELEC  
  "/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem", // CentOS/RHEL 7  
  "/etc/ssl/cert.pem", // Alpine Linux

  Examples of certificate bundle directories:  

  "/etc/ssl/certs", // SLES10/SLES11, https://golang.org/issue/12139  
  "/etc/pki/tls/certs", // Fedora/RHEL

2. Restart the server.

3. Restart the engine (if applicable).
