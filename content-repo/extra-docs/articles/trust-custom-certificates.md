title: Configure Server and Integrations to Trust Custom Certificates
description: Setup the Server and JS/Native Integrations to Trust Custom Certificates.
---

Server initiated communication (for example, downloading a pack from the marketplace), Javascript integrations, and native integrations use the built-in set of CA-Signed certificates of the host machine to validate TLS communication. If you are using an engine, the engine also uses CA-Signed certificates. You can add custom trusted certificates to the host built-in set. (In addition, you will need to [configure Python Docker integrations to trust custom certificates](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xsoar/6-9/cortex-xsoar-admin/docker/configure-python-docker-integrations-to-trust-custom-certificates.html).)
 
1. Add the certificate to the machineâ€™s trusted ROOT CA Bundle. The location of the CA Bundle depends on the version of the operating system and the operating configuration.

Examples of certificate bundle paths:  

"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt", // Debian/Ubuntu/Gentoo etc.  
"/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt", // Fedora/RHEL 6  
"/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem", // OpenSUSE  
"/etc/pki/tls/cacert.pem", // OpenELEC  
"/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem", // CentOS/RHEL 7  
"/etc/ssl/cert.pem", // Alpine Linux

Examples of certificate bundle directories:  

"/etc/ssl/certs", // SLES10/SLES11, https://golang.org/issue/12139  
"/etc/pki/tls/certs", // Fedora/RHEL

2. Restart the server.

3. Restart the engine (if applicable).
