## Alert Configuration
In order for an alert to be pushed as an incident to Cortex XSOAR, you must add **Create XSOAR Incident** as a trigger action for the alert on Splunk.  
After adding the trigger action, you can configure the action to determine how the incident will be created in Cortex XSOAR.

The following fields are available for configuration:

| Field                         | Description                                                                                                             |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name                          | Name of the alert.                                                                                                      |
| Time Occurred (epoch)         | Time when the alert was triggered.                                                                                      |
| Send Alert to all the Servers | If enabled, the alert will be pushed to all configured Cortex XSOAR servers configured.                                 |
| XSOAR Server                  | Cortex XSOAR server to which the incident will be pushed (needed only if *Send Alert to all the Servers* is unchecked). |
| Type                          | Incident type in Cortex XSOAR.                                                                                          |
| Custom Fields                 | A comma-separated, 'key:value' formatted, custom fields pairs.                                                          |
| Labels                        | A comma-separated list of values to set for the labels field in the incident on Cortex XSOAR.                           |
| Severity                      | The severity to set for the incident on Cortex XSOAR.                                                                   |
| Details                       | The details field value to set for the incident on Cortex XSOAR.                                                        |

### Local Splunk Environment Setup
To set up a local environment for testing purposes, run the following command to start a Docker container of Splunk (replace `*****` with any 8-character password, containing letters and digits):
```
docker run -d -p "8000:8000" -p "8088:8088" -p "8089:8089" -e "SPLUNK_START_ARGS=--accept-license" -e "SPLUNK_PASSWORD=*****" --name splunk splunk/splunk:latest
```
Once the container is up and running, the Splunk environment will be accessible on http://localhost:8000.

For more information about the Splunk Docker image and containers configuration, see the official [Splunk DockerHub Page](https://hub.docker.com/r/splunk/splunk/).


### Create an Adaptive Response Action for Splunk Enterprise Security
1. Click **Incident Review**. For Splunk Enterprise Security users, all incidents are reported in the *Incident Review* Dashboard.
2. Click the **Actions** drop-down list for the incident that you want to be created on Cortex XSOAR.
3. Click **Run Adaptive Response Actions**.
4. Click **Add New Response Action**.
5. Select **Create XSOAR Incident** from the list of actions.
6. Fill in the details that need to be sent out to Cortex XSOAR (as described in the [Connectivity Test](#connectivity-test---create-a-custom-alert-action-from-saved-searches). When finished, click **Run**.
7. Splunk will display a message indicating that the action has been dispatched.
8. Back in the main screen of the Incident List table, Click the **I** button to list incidents in detail and track actions that took place when the incident occurred in Splunk.
9. Check the **Adaptive Response** section under details. It should include a response like *XSOAR Custom Alert Action* with a status.
10. Click **XSOAR Custom Alert Action** to drill down to more details on the alert action that was called along with the detailed response received from Cortex XSOAR.


## Troubleshooting
### Logs
Relevant logs for troubleshooting and debugging can be found in the following paths:
- Add-on logs: `var/log/splunk/create_xsoar_incident_modalert.log`
- Splunk logs: `var/log/splunk/splunkd.log`

### Common Issues
#### Splunk Events are not Created in Cortex XSOAR
If after associating Create XSOAR Incident with saved searches, correlation searches using automated invocation, or using ad-hoc invocation from Splunk Enterprise Security's incident review dashboard, incidents are not being created on Cortex XSOAR, the following should be checked:
1. Check the configuration page. You may need to restart the add-on in order for the modifications to take effect.
2. Check the *Saved Search* trigger conditions. Splunk might be suppressing the events, which causes it not to create an incident in Cortex XSOAR.
3. Test the network connectivity in-between applications to ensure there are no connectivity issues. You can use the following commands to test the connectivity:
   ```bash
   # For Cortex XSOAR 6, 'XSOAR_SERVER' is the server URL, including a port if relevant in a <SERVER_ADDRESS>:<PORT> format.
   # For Cortex XSOAR 8 / Cortex XSIAM, 'XSOAR_SERVER' is the API URL.
   curl -kv https://<XSOAR_SERVER>
   telnet https://<XSOAR_SERVER>
   wget --no-check-certificate -O - https://<XSOAR_SERVER>
   ```

4. Test the API key generated in Cortex XSOAR.
   ```bash
   curl -kv -H "Authorization:<API_KEY>" https://<XSOAR_SERVER>/user
   wget --no-check-certificate --header="Authorization: <API_KEY>" -O - https://<XSOAR_SERVER>/user
   ```
   
#### Connection Timeout Errors
Connection timeout errors can be identified in the Splunk logs, and will appear as follows:
```
2022-01-25 02:45:02,941 ERROR pid=**** tid=MainThread file=*** | sendmodaction - signature="Failed creating an incident to server ****. Reason: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='***', port=443): Read timed out. (read timeout=30.0)" action_name="***" search_name="****" action_status="failure"
```
In case of a connection timeout error:
1. Locate the `SavedSplunker` log facility.
2. Increase its verbosity to *ERROR* level.
3. If the logs include the following:  
   ```
   WARN SavedSplunker - Reached maximum amount of time allowed to spend in per-result alerts for savedsearch_id="SAVEDSEARCH_ID"
   ```  
   Increase the *max_per_result_alerts_time* value in the `limits.conf` file.

#### Incidents Created in Cortex XSOAR with Incorrect Fields
If incidents are being created in Cortex XSOAR with incorrect fields, ensure that the **Create XSOAR Incident** trigger action for the alert is configured properly. 
For more information about the fields mapping, see the [Alert Configuration](#alert-configuration) section a

#### Too Many Incidents Are Created in Cortex XSOAR
Splunk has its own trigger conditions using the number of incidents which get pushed to XSOAR controlled.

See Splunk's [Configure alert trigger conditions](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Alert/AlertTriggerConditions) documentation to understand Splunk Trigger Conditions to limit the incidents.  
It is also possible to [throttle alerts](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/Alert/ThrottleAlerts) in Splunk after the saved search returned positive results, in order to suppress more incident creation.

#### Playbooks not getting invoked on Cortex XSOAR
Cortex XSOAR allows users to set up different types of incidents, and the user can associate different playbooks for each type of incident. If after pushing incidents from Splunk, the appropriate playbooks are not being invoked, you should check the following:
1. Check if the type of incident which is getting pushed from Splunk has a playbook associated with the type in Cortex XSOAR.
2. Check if there are no case differences in the type created in Cortex XSOAR and the type which is being pushed along with incident information in Splunk.

#### SSL Certificates Issues
* If you don’t use a certificate, make sure the **Validate SSL** checkbox is not selected.
* If you have a self-signed certificate, you must add it to the Splunk server first, and then set the path to it in the Add-on configuration page.
* In the case of a self-signed certificate, make sure that the whole certificate chain exist. Each of root, intermediate, and client certificate is required.
* When checking SSL certificate validity by pinging, ping to the server domain. SSL certificates are signed on server domain rather than its IP.

#### Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) Issues
If Splunk CIM is installed, make sure its version is compatible with the installed Splunk version. A common error caused by a version incompatibility might look as the following:
  ```
  12-28-2021 13:45:13.807 -0800 ERROR sendmodalert - action=create_xsoar_incident STDERR - NameError: name 'basestring' is not defined
  12-28-2021 13:45:13.807 -0800 ERROR sendmodalert - action=create_xsoar_incident STDERR - if isinstance(self.sid, basestring) and 'scheduler' in self.sid:
  12-28-2021 13:45:13.807 -0800 ERROR sendmodalert - action=create_xsoar_incident STDERR - File "/opt/splunk/etc/apps/Splunk_SA_CIM/lib/cim_actions.py", line 157, in init
  ```
