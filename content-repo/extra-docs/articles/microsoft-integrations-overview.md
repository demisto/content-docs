# Microsoft Azure and O365 Integrations Overview
Microsoft O365 and Azure are extensive platforms with many different products and functionality.
Moreover, the APIs behind them (especially the Microsoft Graph API) are vast and do not fit under one integration.

Review this document to determine the Microsoft integrations you need for your use case.


## Azure Active Directory

### Use Cases

- Create users and groups.
- Remove a member from a group.
- Remove a pre-approved application.

### Playbooks
