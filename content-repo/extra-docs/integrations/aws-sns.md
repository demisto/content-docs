title: AWS Simple Notification Service (AWS SNS)
description: Use AWS SNS to send notifications to XSOAR.
---

You can send Amazon SNS notifications and alerts from all SNS-supported AWS services to XSOAR using HTTPS, to
 automatically create  incidents from the notifications and alerts according to how you map and classify them.

Alerts and notifications are received in near real-time and are not pooled.

## Prerequisites

* Verify that your XSOAR server HTTPS endpoint (port 443) has inbound access to Amazon Web Services.
* Server certificates must be signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) that Amazon supports. For a list of supported CAs that Amazon supports, see the [Amazon documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SendMessageToHttp.https.ca.html).
