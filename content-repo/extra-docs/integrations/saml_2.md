title: SAML 2.0
description: You can authenticate your Demisto users using SAML 2.0 authentication and your organization`s as the identity provider.
---

Use the SAML 2.0 integration to configure single sign-on for your Demisto users, using your organization's identity provider (IdP).

If your IdP is Okta or ADFS refer to the relevant article.

### What is SAML 2.0?

This definition of SAML 2.0 is taken from the [SAML 2.0 page in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0).

Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML 2.0) is a version of the SAML standard for  
exchanging authentication and authorization data between security domains. SAML 2.0 is an  
XML-based protocol that uses security tokens containing assertions to pass information  
about a principal (usually an end user) between a SAML authority, named an Identity  
Provider, and a SAML consumer, named a Service Provider. SAML 2.0 enables web-based  
authentication and authorization scenarios including cross-domain single sign-on (SSO),  
which helps reduce the administrative overhead of distributing multiple authentication  
tokens to the user.

### Configure SAML 2.0 with your IdP

When you configure SAML 2.0, you need to map several attributes from your IdP to Demisto fields. You need to populate the attribute fields in Demisto exactly as they appear in your IdP. For example, if the email attribute in your IdP is email.address, this is the value you need to provide in the Attribute to get email parameter in the SAML 2.0 integration in Demisto.

**IMPORTANT**: It is important that you provide values for all parameters. If you skip parameters, the Demisto user that is created will not contain important attributes and information, and will require you to manually assign a Demisto role to the user that is created.
