title: Malware Investigation and Response
description: The  Malware Investigation and Response content pack provides a framework for handling malware investigations.
---

Malware threat is one of the most common cybersecurity challenges facing businesses today. It causes data breaches, hardware failures, and inoperable computers and system networks that can be extremely costly to recover.  
Malware investigations require security teams to reconcile data from multiple security products like EDRs, sandboxes, malware analysis tools, and threat intelligence providers. 
Performing investigations manually wastes valuable time when malware may be propagating within an organization.

The Malware Investigation & Response content pack accelerates the investigation process for endpoint malware incidents and alerts by collecting evidence of malicious behaviors from telemetry data available through EDRs and processing malware analysis reports through sandboxes. Incident layouts also include buttons to remediate activities quickly.    
The pack closely maps evidence to MITRE ATT&CK to uncover evidence of:
- Persistence (for example, registry and scheduled jobs)
- Evasion or tampering (for example and service stop and process kill)
- Lateral movement (for example, network connections and file share enumeration)
- Powershell abuse and command-line analysis
- Digitally signed files

## What Does This Pack Do?
- Provides forensic data, including running processes and open network connections at alert detection time
- Retrieves files and detonates sandboxes
- Processes select sandbox reports and visualizes the results in layouts
- Extracts indicators and provides threat intelligence enrichment
- Tags malicious and benign indicators for allow and deny lists for threat prevention and false-positive management
- Mirrors incidents between the EDR and Cortex XSOAR and enables incident closure with the EDR
- Supports aggregating incidents from EDRs, including multiple alerts and files
