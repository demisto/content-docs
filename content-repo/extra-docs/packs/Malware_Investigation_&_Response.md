title: Malware Investigation and Response
description: The  Malware Investigation and Response content pack provides a framework for handling malware investigations.
---

Malware threat is one of the most common cybersecurity challenges facing businesses today. It causes data breaches, hardware failures, and inoperable computers and system networks that can be extremely costly to recover.  
Malware investigations require security teams to reconcile data from multiple security products like EDRs, sandboxes, malware analysis tools, and threat intelligence providers. 
Manual investigation wastes valuable time when malware may be propagating within an organization.

The Malware Investigation & Response content pack accelerates the investigation process for endpoint malware incidents and alerts by collecting evidence of malicious behaviors from telemetry data available through EDRs and processing malware analysis reports through sandboxes. Incident layouts also include buttons to remediate activities quickly.    
The pack closely maps evidence to MITRE ATT&CK to uncover evidence of:
- Persistence (for example, registry and scheduled jobs)
- Evasion or tampering (for example and service stop and process kill)
- Lateral movement (for example, network connections and file share enumeration)
- PowerShell abuse and command-line analysis
- Digitally signed files

## What Does This Pack Do?
* Provides forensic data, including running processes and open network connections at alert detection time.
* Retrieves files and detonates sandboxes.
* Analyzes process command-line string for identifying suspicious behavior.
* Processes select sandbox reports and visualizes the results in layouts.
* Extracts indicators and provides threat intelligence enrichment.
* Tags malicious and benign indicators for allow and deny lists for threat prevention and false-positive management.
* Mirrors incidents between the EDR and Cortex XSOAR and enables incident closure with the EDR.
* Supports aggregating incidents from EDRs, including multiple alerts and files.
* Supports fetching malware incidents either from the EDR product or from a SIEM solution.

## Getting Started / How to set up the Pack
### Use the Deployment Wizard (Available for version 6.8)
For better user experience and easier onboarding, use the [**Deployment Wizard**](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xsoar/6-8/cortex-xsoar-admin/marketplace/content-pack-installation/install-a-content-pack/use-the-use-case-deployment-wizard) after installing the content pack on the Marketplace page in Cortex XSOAR (Available for version 6.8).
  ![Deployment Wizard](../../../docs/doc_imgs/reference/MalwareInvestigationAndResponse/Malware_Investigation_And_Response_layout4.png)

### Manually Configure Your Use Case (From Version 6.5)
For manual configuration, it is recommended to configure your integration instance to use: 
- The primary **playbook**: [Malware Investigation and Response Incident Handler](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/malware-investigation--response-incident-handler)
- The primary **incident type**: **Malware Investigation and Response**

#### Fetch Data from an EDR integration
1. In [MarketPlace](https://xsoar.pan.dev/marketplace), select a fetching integration (for more details on supported EDR integrations, check the [Endpoint Integrations](#endpoint-integrations) section):  
   1. PaloAlto Cortex XDR 
   2. Microsoft Defender For Endpoint
   3. CrowdStrike Falcon  
2. In the **Settings** > **Integrations** tab, configure your fetching integration instance.   
   **Note:**  
   Set **Fetch Incidents** to true and set the **Incident Type** to  `Malware Investigation and Response` (for Cortex XDR - you can use the classifier `Cortex XDR Incident Handler - Classifier` instead of the incident type).
3. **Review the master playbook inputs**. These inputs control key features in the investigation process.



#### Fetch Data from a SIEM
If you prefer fetching incidents using a SIEM integration, you need to perform the following steps.  
  
1. **Before you start:** Set up your relevant EDR integration. For more details on supported EDR integrations, check the [Endpoint Integrations](#endpoint-integrations) section.
2. Through your SIEM integration mapper, map the following fields to retrieve all required information:  
   - Original alert ID mapped to  `External System ID` incident field.
   - Incident type mapped to `External Category Name` incident field. (E.g. in CrowdStrike you have 2 different types - Detections and Incidents).
   
   If you do not want to update your current mapper,change the following playbook inputs to the prefered `Alert ID` and the `Incident Type` incident fields in the master playbook ([Malware Investigation and Response Incident Handler](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/malware-investigation--response-incident-handler)):
     - `SIEMincidentFieldForID`  
     - `SIEMincidentFieldForType` 
3. Validate that relevant EDR integration is enabled.
4. Ensure that relevant incoming incidents are assigned with the 'Malware Investigation And Response' incident type (through the SIEM Classifier).

### Additional Integrations
#### Mitre ATT&CK (https://xsoar.pan.dev/marketplace/details/FeedMitreAttackv2)
The Mitre Att&ck integration enables easy classification for investigated incidents and better understanding of the current stage in the kill chain phase. The Mitre Att&ck integration ingests enriched information about the found techniques associated with the incident.  
Information on findings are presented in the layout in the **Investigation Summary** and **Detailed Investigation** sections. Please **enable** this integration ( Optional - decide if you want to enable the fetching setting in advance).

Related Playbook: [Mitre Attack - Extract Technique Information From ID](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/mitre-attack---extract-technique-information-from-id)

### Sandbox Integrations
#### [Palo Alto Networks WildFire](https://xsoar.pan.dev/marketplace/details/Palo_Alto_Networks_WildFire) (Optional)
The Palo Alto Networks Wildfire sandbox integration enables you to automatically identify unknown threats by detonating unknown files. It also stops attacks by dynamically analyzing files.

#### [CrowdStrike FalconX](https://xsoar.pan.dev/marketplace/details/CrowdStrikeFalconX) (Optional)
The CrowdStrike FalconX sandbox integration enables you to automatically identify unknown threats by detonating unknown files and retrieve report information. It also stops attacks by dynamically analyzing files.

### Ticketing Systems  

As part of the True positive flow, the True Positive Incident Handling playbooks (each vendor has its own) enable to open tickets in relevant IT ticketing systems. In order to re-image affected hosts.
The inputs to enable the use of ticketing systems are specified in the main Malware Investigation & Response Incident Handler playbook (TicketingSystemToUse and TicketProjectName). The description for the ticket is derived from the confirmation if a true or false positive task exists for each of the EDR vendor specific playbooks.

#### [ServiceNow](https://xsoar.pan.dev/marketplace/details/ServiceNow) (Optional)
The ServiceNow integration enables to create and manage tickets in ServiceNow.

#### [Jira](https://xsoar.pan.dev/marketplace/details/Jira) (Optional)
The Jira integration enables to create and manage tickets in Jira.

## Endpoint Integrations

- #### [Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR - Investigation and Response](https://xsoar.pan.dev/marketplace/details/CortexXDR)
  **Main Playbook**: [Cortex XDR Malware - Investigation And Response](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/cortex-xdr-malware---investigation-and-response)

  Noteworthy feature in this pack:

  - **Hunting for Dedicated Insights**

     XDR Insights are suspicious activity detections that occur from a rule and are observed and enriched on a dedicated endpoint. This playbook searches for dedicated Insights by filtering them through Mitre Techniques and the investigated endpoint. 

    Related Playbook: [Cortex XDR - Endpoint Investigation](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/cortex-xdr---endpoint-investigation)

- #### [Microsoft Defender For Endpoint](https://xsoar.pan.dev/marketplace/details/MicrosoftDefenderAdvancedThreatProtection)  
  **Main Playbook**: [MDE Malware - Investigation and Response](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/mde-malware---investigation-and-response)

  Noteworthy features in this pack:
  - **Advanced Hunting**  
   Microsoft Defender For Endpoint provides advanced features to query your integrated instance and search for information. This playbook uses pre-defined commands, enrichment logic, and tagging results as incident evidence. 
  
    Related playbook: [MDE - Host Advanced Hunting]()
           
  - **Pro-Active Incident Investigation**  
    The analyst can run the following pro-active incident investigation actions, which can be automated using playbook inputs:
    - Running an automated investigation
    - Running antiVirus full scan on the endpoint
    - Collecting an Investigation Package (forensics). 
    
    Related playbook: [MDE - Pro-Active Actions]()
  
    **Note**:  
    Some playbook inputs can be configured on the [MDE Malware - Investigation and Response](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/mde-malware---investigation-and-response) playbook.

- #### [CrowdStrike Falcon](https://xsoar.pan.dev/marketplace/details/CrowdStrikeFalcon)
  **Main Playbook**: [CrowdStrike Falcon Malware - Investigation and Response](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/crowd-strike-falcon-malware---investigation-and-response)

  Noteworthy feature in this pack:
   - **Allow and Block IOCs Per Device Group**

     Due to the complexity of managing multiple devices and exclusions, a policy may require certain modifications to fit each device group. This playbook enables choosing which device groups (specific or all groups) will be affected by your exclusions. In order to enable these settings use the playbooks input ApplyOCGlobally and HostGroupName which can be defined in the CrowdStrike Falcon - True Positive Incident Handling and CrowdStrike Falcon - False Positive Incident Handling playbooks.

   - **Pivoting from CrowdStrike Detections to Incidents**

     CrowdStrike Falcon has the concepts of detections which are single alerts and Incidents which can contain multiple detections. The CrowdStrike Falcon integration supports fetching incidents as well as detections. As the data provided for fetched CrowdStrike incidents is limited the pack contains the playbook CrowdStrike Falcon - Get Detections by Incident which enables to list CrowdStrike detections that are associated to a CrowdStrike incident and add all the relevant data from the detection to the XSOAR incident.
 

**Notes**:  

- The main playbooks contain most of the common playbook inputs across vendor playbooks, however specific vendor inputs are not in the main playbook. For example:  

  - In the [CrowdStrike Falcon Malware - Investigation and Response](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/crowd-strike-falcon-malware---investigation-and-response) playbook, you may find the following inputs:  
  (which are responsible for managing IOCs through the EDR system)
    - `HostGroupName`  
    - `ApplyIOCGlobally`
  - In the [MDE Malware - Investigation and Response](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/mde-malware---investigation-and-response) playbook, you may find the following inputs:   
    (which are responsible setting up the Pro-active activities)
    - `ActionTask` 
    - `AutoAVScan` 
    - `AutoAutomatedInvestigation`
    - `AutoCollectinvestigationPackege`

- XSOAR supports pre-processing rules for incidents as detailed [here](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/incidents/incident-pre-processing), which can be used for handling incidents that share the same incident information (e.g. alert names, IPs, hashes, etc).
However, XSOAR also supports deduplication. Unlike Pre-processing rules, deduplication can use a configurable similarity setting and not just an exact value match.
In such a scenario, using mirroring functionality can be beneficial as it will allow you to handle the same incidents in both XSOAR and your EDR consoles ( check your EDR pack in advance if it supports this function).
For more details about the deduplication check the following playbook > [Dedup - Generic V4 playbook](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/dedup---generic-v4)
Some of those inputs are exposed in the master playbook, and some are through each vendor's main playbook. For example:  
  - `DedupSimilarTextField` 
  - `DedupMinimunIncidentSimilarity`


 
## Pack Disclaimers
1. The current layout shows only one item being searched (for example, one endpoint or one file SHA256) even though the logic is running and analyzing all the relevant information and performing enrichment on all the items.
2. Some actions are irreversible. For example, the analyst should be careful when deleting files since deleting a file cannot be reversed (do not delete explorer.exe from the investigated device).
3. The logic supports **only** Microsoft Windows OS platforms. However, certain parts of the playbooks can analyze and provide information on other operating systems. For example, the sandbox section can run on Linux, Mac, Android, and others.
5. Keep in mind that setting the `DedupHandleSimilar` input to 'Close' may permanently close incidents with status 'Pending'. This means you cannot reopen it (However you may 'Delete' or 'Mark as Duplicate').
