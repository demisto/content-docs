The **Malware Investigation and Response** content pack provides a generic framework to handle malware investigation. This pack incorporates the most relevant integrations in Cortex XSOAR for handling malware incidents.

The playbook in this pack includes the following steps: 
- Evidence of Persistence (registry, scheduled jobs etc., …)
- Evidence of Evasion or Tampering (service stop,  process kill etc., …)
- Evidence of Lateral Movement (network connections, file share enumeration etc.…)
- Powershell abuse and Command-line analysis
- Digitally signed file
- and more …

Other notable capabilities:
- Forensic data including, running processes and open network connections at alert detection time
- File retrieval and sandbox detonation
- Processing of select sandbox reports & layout visualization
- Indicator extraction and threat intelligence enrichment
- Tagging of malicious and benign indicators to tie into allow & deny lists for threat prevention and false- positive management
- Incident mirroring & closure with EDR
- Support for aggregate incidents from EDRs, which may include multiple alerts & files


These steps provide a solid basis and guidelines for malware investigation.

## Pack Workflow
