title: XSOAR CI/CD
description: This process encapsulates what you need in order to control your XSOAR machines in an automated manner, while providing the ability to manage your own content, in your artifacts server of choice, with your version control system of choice.
---
​
The XSOAR CI/CD content pack is intended to help security engineers develop, test, review, implement, and maintain their content in a smooth and secure process. It allows you to create your content alongside other members of your security team, and merge that content to ensure you have not overwritten work done by someone else, or vice versa. In addition, you can manage your content in a single, yet separate, repository with the out-of-the-box content provided by Cortex XSOAR. Also, you can track the versioning of your content to support rolling back, if necessary.
​
For example, you can implement unit tests, make sure that the content that you have created is compatible with your integrations, etc.
​
The pack is used to make sure that content that is developed is implemented in your environment while making certain that changes you make to your content does not break existing flows. This enables you to develop and implement with confidence that and security.
​
The CI/CD process works as follows:
​
* create your own repository in which to create your content. The examples provided in the pack are based on GitHub, however, you can use any git-supported platform.
​
* set up the repository using the hierarchy provided in the content pack. For example, Packs -> Entities -> etc.
​
* configure your CI/CD - the pack provides a template to execute your CI/CD process.
​
* content is saved in a bucket in your cloud provider. The examples in the pack are based on Google Cloud Storage, but the pack can be configured to work with other vendors, too.
​
* run a playbook that reads from a configuration file that determines which content to install in your environment. The configuration file contains a list of content to install from your bucket.
​
​

## Prerequisites
​
The following are the prerequisites for using this pack:
- [Create the Repository](#create-the-repository)

### Create the CI/CD Process
​
Create a yml file for the CI/CD process. The [Example File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/master/Packs/ContentManagement/docs-files/ci-cd.yml) is a GitHub actions YML file that can be used as a template for creating your CI/CD process.
​
​
1. Prepare the environment and the virtual environment on which to run the demisto-sdk. 
2. Create an ID set for the private repository using the [demisto-sdk create-id-set](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk/tree/master/demisto_sdk/commands/create_id_set) command.
3. Merge the ID set with the Content repository's ID set using the following command: ***demisto-sdk merge-id-sets -i1 <path_to_private_repo_id__set> -i2 <path_to_content_repo_id_set> -o <path_to_output>***.
4. Validate the packs' files using the [demisto-sdk validate](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/concepts/demisto-sdk#validate) command.
5. Run unit tests and linters on the packs using the [demisto-sdk lint](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/concepts/demisto-sdk#lint) command.
6. Create uploadable pack zips using the [demisto-sdk zip-packs](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk/tree/master/demisto_sdk/commands/zip_packs) command.
​
   Or 
​
   Upload zipped packs directly to your machine using the [demisto-sdk upload](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/concepts/demisto-sdk#upload) command.
7. Upload the artifacts to your artifact repository.
​
​
​
### Create the Structure for the Artifacts Server
This artifacts server structure enables you to keep track of your work. Your versions are saved in the *production* folder. The *builds* folder saves your test packs before your deploy them.
