title: Email Communication
description: Communication across and between departments is a vital component of collecting information and managing and remediating security events. The Email Communication content pack enables security teams to automate and streamline the communication and notification process with users across your organization via email.
 
---
The Email Communication content pack enables security teams to interact with end users or third parties using email as part of an incident. The SOC team is able to communicate directly through the Cortex XSOAR platform as part of the remediation process.

## Pack Overview  
This content pack includes two options for adding email functionality: the **Email Communication** incident type and layout, and the **Email Threads** layout.

### Email Communication Incident Type and Layout
The **Email Communication** incident type and layout allow Cortex XSOAR to fetch new emails from your mail listener and create new incidents from them if they are not related to an existing case.  You can then reply to the original sender and include additional recipients if needed.  This incident type and layout are intended for use when the incoming email is the incident trigger, and only one email thread is needed per incident.

### Email Threads Layout
The **Email Threads** layout adds email functionality to any incident type where it is needed, including incidents triggered by sources other than incoming email.  You can initiate new email conversations from the **Email Threads** layout and replies will be attached to the same incident.  You can also create multiple separate email threads, allowing you to interact with different groups of users and keep conversations separate.  This layout is intended for use when the first email on a thread is sent outbound from Cortex XSOAR.

## Pack Workflow
1. When an email is sent to the email address configured in your email integration, your email listener fetches the incoming email into Cortex XSOAR. 

2. If the email is in response to an existing incident, an 8-digit number will appear next to the subject of the email, for example <93075875> Incident1. The pre-process script searches for incidents that have this 8-digit code in either the *emailgeneratedcode* or *emailgeneratedcodes* fields.

3. If there is no 8-digit number in the subject of the email or if the pre-process rule is unable to locate the 8-digit number, a new **Email Communication** incident is created and a random 8-digit number is generated for the incident. 

4. If there is an 8-digit number in the subject of the email and the pre-process rule is able to locate the incident associated with the 8-digit number, the email is added to the existing email thread and not as a separate unlinked email.  If the related incident is closed, the pre-process script re-opens the incident.

5. You can view the email thread in the incident layout. You can also reply to the email thread in the incident layout. 

## In This Pack
The Email Communication content pack includes several content items.

### Automations
* [DisplayEmailHtml](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/scripts/display-email-html): Displays the original email in HTML format in the Email Communication incident layout.

* [DisplayEmailHtmlThread](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/scripts/display-email-html-thread): Displays a complete email chain as a single HTML formatted document in the Email Threads incident layout.

* [SummarizeEmailThreads](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/scripts/summarize-email-threads): Displays a table summarizing all email threads present on an incident using the Email Threads layout.

* [PreprocessEmail](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/scripts/preprocess-email): Pre-process script for Email Communication layout. This script checks if the incoming email contains an 8-digit number to link the mail to an existing incident, and tags the email as "email-thread". 

* [SendEmailReply](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/scripts/send-email-reply): Sends the email reply. 

### Classifiers

## Before You Start

This pack requires that you have active instances of both a mail listener and mail sender integration in order to send and receive emails, and an active instance of the Demisto REST API integration. Configure either the [Gmail integration](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/gmail) or [MS Graph Mail Single User integration](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/microsoft-graph-mail-single-user) or the [MS Graph Mail integration](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/microsoft-graph-mail), or both the [EWS Mail Sender](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/ews-mail-sender) and [EWS V2](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/ews-v2) integrations. In addition, configure the Demisto REST API integration which requires a Demisto API key.
 
The out-of-the-box classification and mapping (for EWS, Gmail, MS Graph Mail, and MS Graph Mail Single user) in the pack map the incident data to custom incident fields.
These custom incident fields are populated with specific values for the Email Communication scripts to execute.
 
If an EWS, Gmail, MS Graph Mail or MS Graph Mail Single user instance is already configured for other incident types, create a new instance for the email communication type with the associated classification and mapping. 

 ## Pack Configurations
To get up and running with this pack, you must do the following: 
- [Configure Demisto REST API Integration](#demisto-rest-api-integration)
- [Create a pre-process rule that will link the emails to an existing incident](#pre-process-rule)
- [Configure the *service_mail* and *mail_sender_instance* parameters](#configure-the-*service_mail*-and-*mail_sender_instance*-Parameters)

### Demisto REST API Integration
The scripts in the pack require that you install the **Demisto REST API** integration and configure an integration instance.

1. In Cortex XSOAR, go to **Settings > INTEGRATIONS > API Keys**.
2. Click the **Get Your Key**, enter a name for the API key, and click **Generate Key**.
3. **(IMPORTANT)** Copy and save the API key, you will not be able to access it again.
4. Go to **Settings > INTEGRATIONS > Servers & Services** and search for **Demisto REST API**.
5. Click **Add instance** and enter the required information.
    - A meaningful name for the integration instance
    - Demisto Server URL
    - API key that you generated
7. Click the **Test** button to make sure that that server and API key are reachable and valid.
8. Click **Done**.

### Pre-Process Rule
 
This pack requires that you configure a pre-process rule to link the email communications with the incident. (The email reply will be linked to the same incident and will not create a new one). To configure the pre-process rule:

1.  Navigate to **Settings -> Integrations -> Pre-Process Rules**. 
2.  Click **New Rule**.
3.  Enter a name for the rule.
1. In the Conditions for Incoming Incident section, enter the following:  
**Type** - **Equals** - **Email Communication**. 
2. If you are using a Gmail instance, you should add another condition:  
**Email Labels** -  **Doesn't Contain** - **SENT**.
3. In the Action section, select: **Run a script**.
4. In the Choose a script section, select: **PreprocessEmail**.
5. Click **Save**.


![Preprocess-rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/84e7bc89c8757544804540e6711d4b9aba210ec1/Packs/EmailCommunication/doc_files/pre-process-rule.png)

See [pre-processing rules](https://demisto.developers.paloaltonetworks.com/docs/incidents/incident-pre-processing) for additional information.

### Configure the *service_mail* and *mail_sender_instance* Parameters 
The *service_mail* parameter sets the sender's email address. This parameter is optional when using the *Email Communication* incident type and layout, but is required to use the *Email Threads* layout.

The *mail_sender_instance* parameter sets the specific Integration instance to use to send email messages.  This parameter is optional.

The **SendEmailReply** script runs the ***reply-mail*** and ***send-mail*** commands and all the supported integrations send the email.
If the *mail_sender_instance* parameter is empty and only one mail sender integration is configured, an email will be sent from the email address configured in the integration. If several integrations that provide the ***reply-mail*** and/or ***send-mail*** commands are configured this will result in multiple copies of the email being sent, one from each integration instance.

You can configure the *service_mail* and *mail_sender_instance* parameters for the following uses:
- Send the email from one default email address - If multiple email-sender integrations or instances are configured, you can configure the *mail_sender_instance* parameter to a specific integration instance.
- Send the emails from a different sender each time - This is particularly useful for MSSPs when the sender address changes per customer, incident type, and so on. You can configure the parameters to be mandatory, so each time you click **send reply** (**Email Communication** layout) or **Send New Email** / **Reply To Thread** (**Email Threads** layout), a pop-up will appear in which you will need to enter the service_mail email address and mail_sender_instance name.

## Add Email Threads Functionality to Custom Incident Types
The **Email Threads** layout allows you to add email functionality to any existing incident types and layouts where it is needed using the following procedures.  
**Note:**  
It is important to follow these procedures completely, or Email Threads functionality will not work as expected.

### Add the **Email Threads** Tab to an Existing Incident Layout 
1. Navigate to **Settings -> Objects Setup -> Incidents -> Layouts**.
2. Check the box next to the desired layout and then click the **Edit** button.
3. Click **Tabs** in the Library and search for **Email Threads**.
4. Drag the item named **Email Threads (Email Threads)** to the desired position on your layout.
5. Click **Save**.

### Add Required Incident Fields to the Incident Types Where Email Threads will be Used
1. Navigate to **Settings -> Objects Setup -> Incidents -> Incident Fields**.
2. Check the box next to the field named **Email New Recipients** and then click the **Edit** button.
3. In the editor window that appears, click the **Attributes** tab.
4. Select the new incident type(s) you wish to add email functionality to in the **Add to Incident types** section.
5. Click **Save**.
6. Repeat steps 2 - 5 for each of the following Incident Fields:
   - Add BCC To Email
   - Add CC To Email
   - Email Generated Codes
   - Email New Subject
   - Email New Body
   - Email New Attachment
   - Email Selected Thread

## Configure Related Incident Query Window (Optional)
The pre-process script searches for incidents related to incoming emails that contain an 8-digit code to attach the email to.  The default time window for this search is the past 60 days.  This limit is set to preserve system resources, and should be left at default if possible.

If you need to adjust the query window however, you can do so by creating a new Cortex XSOAR list to store the configuration parameter by following these steps:
1. Navigate to **Settings -> Advanced -> Lists** and click the **Add a List** button.
2. In the List settings, enter the name "XSOAR - Email Communication Days To Query" exactly as it appears here.
3. Select **Text** as the Content Type for the list.
4. In the list contents pane, enter the number of days you wish the pre-processing script to search for related incidents.  Enter only a number, for example "90".  Do not enter any other text into the list.
5. Click **Save**.

## Configure Custom Email Signature for New Email Threads (Optional)
You can create a custom email signature to be automatically appended to new outgoing email messages.  This signature can be simple text, or it can include HTML formatting.

Use the following steps to configure a custom signature:
1. Navigate to **Settings -> Advanced -> Lists** and click the **Add a List** button.
2. In the List settings, enter the name "XSOAR - Email Communication Signature" exactly as it appears here.
3. Select **HTML** as the Content Type for the list.
4. Enter your signature in the list contents pane.
5. Click **Save**.

## Testing the Pack
After you configure the integrations and the pre-process rule, test that the incidents/layouts you wish to use are working correctly.

### Email Communication Incident Type and Layout
1. Send an email to the email address configured in your email listener integration.
2. Go to the Incidents page and check that an incident was created.
3. Click the incident. 
4. In the **Email Communication** layout create and send a reply to the email. 
5. Refresh the page and see that your reply appears in the **Email Thread** section.
6. Reply to the reply email sent from Cortex XSOAR and verify that your reply email was added to the email thread.

### Email Threads Layout
1. Open an incident where you have added the **Email Threads** layout.
2. Create a new outbound email to your own email address, then click the **Send New Email** button.
3. Open the War Room of your incident and confirm that a message appears that your email was sent successfully.
4. Find the email in your mailbox and send a reply to it.
5. Wait a few minutes for Cortex XSOAR to fetch the reply, then confirm it appears in the thread viewer section in the lower left of the **Email Threads** tab of your incident.  You may need to enter the number of your thread in the **Email Selected Thread** field and click the button to update the thread viewer to see your new reply.

## Integrations

Although these integrations are not included in the pack, either the Gmail, MS Graph Mail, MS Graph Mail Single User, EWS Mail Sender, or EWS V2 integrations are required for the pack to work.
