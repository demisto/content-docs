# Cortex XSOAR Content Developer Docs
This repo holds Cortex XSOAR's Content Developer Docs. The Content Developer Docs provide information on how to develop Content for the Cortex XSOAR platform. The actual content is hosted at the following repo: https://github.com/demisto/content. 

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

You can access the generated website at: https://xsoar.pan.dev/ 

## Running the site locally
### Node Setup
We use node 12.x for running the project. It is recommended to use `nvm`. See: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm for install instructions. It is recommended to setup `auto use` as specified here: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#calling-nvm-use-automatically-in-a-directory-with-a-nvmrc-file . The root dir of the project contains a proper `.nvmrc` file with the recommended version to use.

### Install and Start
Install all dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Start the development server on: http://localhost:3000
```
npm start
```
Start writing docs...

## Generating Reference Docs
Reference docs are generated from the Cortex XSOAR Content repository: https://github.com/demisto/content . To generate the docs we use [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv). Make sure to install pipenv by running: `pip3 install pipenv`.

When working locally you can generate the reference docs by running:
```
npm run reference-docs
```
This task will checkout the content repository and generate the docs. The generated docs are ignored by `.gitignore` and shouldn't be checked in as they are generated during the build.

When generating the docs the `master` branch of the `content` repo will be used or if there is a matching branch with the same name as the current branch of `content-docs`, that branch will be used.

### Generation Code
Code used for generating content reference docs is written in Python and resides in the `content-repo` folder. To setup a development environment we use [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv). Make sure to install pipenv by running: `pip3 install pipenv`. Setup a proper Python env by running:
```
pipenv install --dev
```
To run linting and unit tests you can use npm:
```
npm run test
```
Linting and unit tests are run on each commit using Github Actions. They are required to pass in-order to merge PRs.

## Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
