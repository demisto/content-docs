# Cortex XSOAR Content Developer Docs
This repo holds Cortex XSOAR Content Developer Docs. The Content Developer Docs provide information on how to develop and contribute content to the Cortex XSOAR platform. The actual content is hosted at the following repo: https://github.com/demisto/content. 

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

You can access the generated website at: https://xsoar.pan.dev/ 

## Running the site locally
### Node Setup
We use node 14.x for running the project. It is recommended to use `nvm`. See: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm for install instructions. It is recommended to setup `auto use` as specified here: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#calling-nvm-use-automatically-in-a-directory-with-a-nvmrc-file . The root dir of the project contains a proper `.nvmrc` file with the recommended version to use.

### Install and Start
Install all dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Start the development server on: http://localhost:3000
```
npm start
```
Start writing docs...

## Generating Reference Docs
Reference docs are generated from the [Cortex XSOAR Content repository](https://github.com/demisto/content). If you are working on general site docs which are not reference docs from the Content repo, you don't need to run this step to preview your docs.

To generate the docs we use [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv). Make sure to install pipenv by running: `pip3 install pipenv`.

When working locally you can generate the reference docs by running:
```
npm run reference-docs
```
This task will checkout the content repository and generate the docs. The generated docs are ignored by `.gitignore` and shouldn't be checked in as they are generated during the build.

When generating the docs the `master` branch of the `content` repo will be used unless there is a matching branch with the same name as the current branch of `content-docs`, that branch will be used. 

If you have the `content` repo checked out locally and you want to use it for generating the reference docs (for example when working on a Content Integration Doc), you can set the path to your `content` repo dir with the environment variable: `CONTENT_REPO_DIR`. For example:
```bash
 CONTENT_REPO_DIR=~/dev/demisto/content npm run reference-docs
```
Additional env vars that affect the generation of the docs:
* `FILE_REGEX`: specify a regex to select which docs to generate docs for. For example: 
  ```bash
  FILE_REGEX=Proofpoint CONTENT_REPO_DIR=~/dev/demisto/content npm run reference-docs
  ```
* `MAX_FILES`: max files to generate in each category. Set this for faster generation when developing. Note also in CI builds on branches this is automatically set to speed up the preview site if there are only modifications related to docs. For example:
  ```bash
  MAX_FILES=10 CONTENT_REPO_DIR=~/dev/demisto/content npm run reference-docs
  ```
* `UPDATE_PACK_DOCS`: set this when you want to update [pack-docs.md](docs/documentation/pack-docs.md) with the supported tags. Make sure NOT to check-in the modified doc.
* `SKIP_DEPRECATED`: skip calculating and generating deprecated doc. Set this for faster file generation when developing. For example:
  ```bash
  SKIP_DEPRECATED=true MAX_FILES=10 CONTENT_REPO_DIR=~/dev/demisto/content npm run reference-docs
  ```
  
  
## Generating Marketplace Docs
Marketplace docs are generated from the content google cloud bucket. If you are working on general site docs which are not related to marketplace, you don't need to run this step to preview the marketplace tab.

To generate the docs we use [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv). Make sure to install pipenv by running: `pip3 install pipenv`.

When working locally you can generate the reference docs by running:
```
npm run marketplace-docs
```
This task will download the packs information from the google cloud bucket and generate the packs docs for the marketplace tab. The generated docs are ignored by `.gitignore` and shouldn't be checked in as they are generated during the build.

Additional env vars that affect the generation of the docs:
* `MAX_PACKS`: max packs to generate in the marketplace tab. Set this for faster generation when developing. Note also in CI builds on branches this is automatically set to speed up the preview site if there are only modifications related to docs. For example:
  
  ```export MAX_PACKS=10 && npm run marketplace-docs```
  
```
NOTE : When running locally, in order to see links from the entities in the marketplace to their corresponding README in the reference section, you will need to run the reference-docs script before running the marketplace-docs script.
```

### Generation Code
Code used for generating content reference docs is written in Python and resides in the `content-repo` folder. To set up a development environment we use [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv). Make sure to install pipenv by running: `pip3 install pipenv`. Setup a proper Python env by running:
```
pipenv install --dev
```
To run linting and unit tests you can use npm:
```
npm run test
```
Linting and unit tests are run on each commit using Github Actions. They are required to pass in-order to merge PRs.

## Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
