Documentation is a critical step that assists customers who may use your integration/script/playbook by providing insight into how the content entity is supposed to work.  
From creating custom playbooks, to providing background information to assist in debugging, it is important to ensure that the documentation explains every aspect of the integration. Documentation is maintained as `README.md` per integration/automation/playbook and made available for customers as part of the [reference docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/index) of the Cortex XSOAR Developer Hub.

:::note
This document guides you through the generation of the README files from entity YML files. When writing the actual entity descriptions, make sure to follow our [Documentation Best Practices](../documentation/documentation_tips).
:::

## Documentation _must_ be generated if:

1. If the content entity is new then you are required to create new documentation.
2. If the content entity is existing but missing documentation then please create new documentation.
3. If the content entity is existing and some of it has changed. For example, a new command was added, context was changed, or anything else; please update the documentation.

:::note
The entity README.md file should not be confused with the Content Pack README.md file (documented [here](../documentation/pack-docs)) or the integration description file, documented [here](../documentation/integration-description).
:::

## Creating Documentation

Use the `demisto-sdk generate-docs` command to generate documentation for your content entity. Documentation for the command is available [here](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk#generate-docs).

### Command Examples - Integration Documentation

To automatically generate example output (human readable and context), you should create a text file containing command examples, one per line. The command examples should appear the same way they would as in the CLI in Cortex XSOAR, for example `!url url=8.8.8.8`.
Commands will be executed one at a time, in the order in which they appear in the file. If there are duplicates of a command included in the text file, only the output of the command's first execution  will be included in the generated documentation output.

Create a `command_examples` file in the same directory as the Integration. Make sure to check this file in to git, so if needed to regenerate the documentation in the future, the commands are easily available. Example for `command_examples` file:

```
!ip ip=8.8.8.8
!domain domain=demisto.com
```

A larger example of such a file is available [here](https://github.com/demisto/content/blob/306f7715ef7a3d4c45f6063caa051b9b99d6b7eb/Packs/Jira/Integrations/JiraV3/command_examples).

### Run `demisto-sdk generate-docs`
Make sure to set your environment variables: `DEMISTO_BASE_URL` and `DEMISTO_API_KEY` so `demisto-sdk` will be able to connect to the Server to run the commands. Run the `generate-docs` command with an input of the content entity's yml file and the `command_examples` file in case you are documenting an integration. For example:

```bash
demisto-sdk generate-docs --insecure -e Packs/Nmap/Integrations/Nmap/command_examples -i Packs/Nmap/Integrations/Nmap/Nmap.yml
Start generating integration documentation...
found the following commands:
!nmap-scan options="-sV" targets=scanme.nmap.org
Output file was saved to :
/Users/glichtman/dev/demisto/content/Packs/Nmap/Integrations/Nmap/README.md
```

:::note
If you are connecting to a Server with a self signed certificate, make sure to pass the `--insecure` option to the `generate-docs` command.
:::

For additional information you can view the full documentation for the command [here](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk/tree/master/demisto_sdk/commands/generate_docs#generate-docs).

#### New Versions of Existing Integrations

In case documentation is being generated for a new version of an existing integration the `generate-docs` command will ask you to enter the path to the old integration .yml file in order to generate a section detailing the changes made in the current version.
You can either enter the old integration path via a prompt in your terminal while the command is running or supplying to the `--old-version` flag like so:

```bash
demisto-sdk generate-docs -i Packs/Nmap/Integrations/NmapV2/NmapV2.yml --old-version Packs/Nmap/Integrations/NmapV1/NmapV1.yml
```

Though not advised, if you do not wish to create the version differences section in the documentation you can run the command with the `--skip-breaking-changes` flag.

## Images

Images can be added to your documentation files. For information, see  [Images in Documentation Files](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/documentation/images_in_documentation_files).

## Videos

A video can provide a great addition to the documentation either as a demo video or tutorial. The preferred video format is `mp4`. 

### Videos Stored in GitHub

Because of their size and in order to keep our main Content repo small, we store large media files in a separate repository. 

To add the video file, open a pull request with the video file at [content-assets](https://github.com/demisto/content-assets/pulls) repository. The file should be placed in the directory: `Assets/<PackName>/`. 

All videos should be included with absolute URLs. To obtain a URL to a video from GitHub follow the same steps as detailed for images only now this is being done in the [content-assets](https://github.com/demisto/content-assets) repository.

Include the video using the HTML `<video>` tag, such as:

```html
<video controls>
    <source src="https://github.com/demisto/content-assets/raw/7982404664dc68c2035b7c701d093ec026628802/Assets/FeedJSON/Json_generic_feed_demo.mp4"
            type="video/mp4"/>
    Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. You can download the video at: https://github.com/demisto/content-assets/blob/7982404664dc68c2035b7c701d093ec026628802/Assets/FeedJSON/Json_generic_feed_demo.mp4 
</video>
```

**Note:** GitHub markdown preview will not display the video (it will show the `browser not supported message`). Rest assured, the dev docs site will display the video properly as can be seen at the following [example](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/json-feed#demo-video).

#### Large Files (over 50MB)

For files larger than 50MB, we require using [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to add these files to the content repo (a getting started git-lfs tutorial is available [here](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Tutorial)).

Steps for adding a large file:

* Clone or fork the [content-assets](https://github.com/demisto/content-assets) repository.
* Make sure you have git-lfs installed. See instructions [here](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation).
* Install git-lfs in the repo: `git lfs install`.
* Copy the video file to the proper directory: `Assets/<PackName>`.
* Add the video as a **tracked** file: `git lfs track Assets/<PackName>/<video_file_name>.mp4`.
* Add the file to git: `git add Assets/<PackName>/<video_file_name>.mp4`.
* Add the `.gitattributes` file: `git add .gitattributes`.
* Commit and push using: `git commit` and `git push`.
* Open a pull a request.

### Videos via External Hosting (YouTube)

You can also embed videos from external services such as YouTube via an iframe. From the external service choose to share the video and choose the **Embed** option. Then choose to **Copy** the embed snippet. 

Screenshots from YouTube:

**Share Dialog:**
<img width="515" src="/doc_imgs/integrations/youtube-embed.png" />  

**Embed Dialog:**
<img width="425" src="/doc_imgs/integrations/youtube-embed-2.png" />

Paste the embed snippet in the README documentation page. Make sure to change the `allowfullscreen` option to include `allowfullscreen="true"`. For example:

```html
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.YouTube.com/embed/s9lRtJltTGI" frameborder="0" 
allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
```

## Posting Documentation

The documentation should be posted in the content entity's directory as a `README.md` file. If the content entity is not in the [Directory Structure](../integrations/package-dir), name the documentation file the same as the yml file without the `.yml` extension and with an ending of: `_README.md`. For example: [integration-mcafeeDam_README.md](https://github.com/demisto/content/blob/master/Packs/mcafeeDam/Integrations/integration-mcafeeDam_README.md).

## Documentation Deployment

Once the PR with the documentation README file is merged into master, it will become available as part of the Cortex XSOAR Developer Hub. The site is updated with the latest content on a daily basis. When the deployment is complete, the documentation will be available at the [reference docs section](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/index). If you wish to preview how the documentation looks at the Developer Hub, before merging to master, you can either run locally the `content-docs` project to preview the Reference Docs site locally or create a PR at the [content-docs repo](https://github.com/demisto/content-docs).

### Preview by Generating Reference Docs Locally (recommended)

Clone or download the [content-docs repo](https://github.com/demisto/content-docs). Follow the instructions at the project's [README](https://github.com/demisto/content-docs/blob/master/README.md) to run the site locally and generate Reference Docs for the `content` repo you have locally. For example run in the `content-docs` checkout dir:

```bash
CONTENT_REPO_DIR=~/dev/demisto/content npm run reference-docs && npm start
```

### Preview by Creating a PR at the Content Docs Repo

Create a PR at the [content-docs repo](https://github.com/demisto/content-docs) with the same branch name as the PR you are working on in the [content repo](https://github.com/demisto/content-docs). Mention in the PR that it is related to a PR from the content repo. Your PR in the content-docs repo will include a preview link in the GitHub Checks section from `deploy/netlify`. You can perform a dummy white space change for the PR that will re-trigger the build and create a new preview. Example screenshot for preview link:

<img width="500" src="/doc_imgs/integrations/doc-preview-check.png" />

## Notes

We use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for the Markdown generation. MDX is a superset of standard Markdown, but it requires that any html used in the document must be jsx compliant. Meaning all html tags need to contain a closing tag. For example don't use: `<br>`, use: `<br/>`. Additionally, html entities `< >` not in code blocks, need to be html-encoded. Use `&lt;` and `&gt;` to encode. As part of the CircleCI build, the README.md file will be validated for MDX compliance.
