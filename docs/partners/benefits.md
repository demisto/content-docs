The Cortex XSOAR Marketplace is the industry’s most comprehensive storefront for discovering, exchanging, and contributing integrated security automation playbooks and content. When Cortex XSOAR partners contribute to the Marketplace, we strive to showcase the many different ways that their product can be beneficial to a customer’s unique ecosystem. These marketing opportunities educate our customers, prospects, sales team, and other cyber curious individuals on the critical use cases these packs address.

When your organization participates in the Cortex XSOAR Marketplace program, you gain guidance with creating your content packs, curated marketing collateral--some of which is hosted on the Palo Alto Networks website--and the possibility of participating in webinars and events. Additionally, Cortex XSOAR customers can become *your* prospects. 

If you join the Cortex XSOAR Marketplace, Palo Alto Networks may highlight your product in the following ways: 
* Marketplace Listing featured in the product 
* Public version of the Marketplace 
* Joint Solution Brief using our format  
* Blog on the Palo Alto Networks site
* Social media mentions and cross promotion
* Placement in the monthly What’s SOARing Newsletter 
* Press Release ready for publication
* A Featured Spot in our monthly Webinar Series
* Additional webinars featuring customers 
* Participation in other joint marketing sponsorships and events

## Marketplace
The Cortex XSOAR Marketplace displays the full library of content packs for anyone to browse. Each pack contains a summary, contents, and links to related collateral. The Marketplace listing is managed by the contributor that provides full flexibility over the messaging and language. 

Marketplace content is available publicly & inside the product. 
* The _public version is accessible_ via the [web](https://xsoar.pan.dev/marketplace). Each pack has a unique link that partners can send to customers, place in marketing pieces, etc. 
* Customers, SIs, and community edition users can view the Marketplace located directly _inside the product_. From there, they can instantly download and deploy your content.

Our platform ensures both sites stay in sync.
