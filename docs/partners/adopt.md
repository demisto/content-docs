title: Adopt-a-Pack

The Cortex XSOAR Adopt-a-Pack program provides our technical partners a way to ‘take over’ a pack that was originally written by Demisto or Cortex XSOAR developers. The partner becomes the maintainer and supporter of the pack and receives several benefits as outlined below.

## Benefits for our Partner
Adopting a Pack has several advantages for the partner:
- The partner directly controls the pack’s roadmap, features and release timing.
- The partner receives direct feedback from customers in the form of defects and enhancement requests.
- The partner is added as a reviewer in GitHub so they can see all community updates to that pack.
- The partner places their name on the pack.
- The partner can engage in marketing activities with Palo Alto Networks.

## Process
The process to Adopt-a-Pack is simple:
- Partner signs the Palo Alto Networks Technology Partnership Agreement. If you've already signed a similar agreement, you will not have to sign again. 
- Partner notifies Palo Alto Networks that they wish to adopt the pack. *Important:* please notify us so we can work with you. 
- Partner clones existing pack and updates the pack (improves marketing, adds new commands/APIs, adds playbooks, adds support information, etc.).
- Partner submits a Pull Request adding their new pack to the Cortex XSOAR Marketplace. Usually we add "v2" to the end of the name. 
- Palo Alto Networks will mark the original pack as Deprecated and direct customers to the new pack. Palo Alto Networks will still maintain the old pack and support existing customers that do not wish to migrate to the new pack. Maintenance will only include bug fixes and will not include new features or enhancements.
