## Easier than you think!

Building a pack with the Cortex XSOAR platform is easier than you might think. Map your product APIs/commands into the Cortex XSOAR language so they can be called by our orchestration engine. Add them to sample playbooks so prospects can see how it works. Build out use cases that solve customer needs. 

## What's the cost? 

$0! Free. There is no cost to join and build your pack. Just some elbow grease.  


## Joint marketing! 

After your pack is approved and deployed via our global content delivery service, we’ll post your pack on our locator and connect you with our marketing team to show the value of our joint products. Depending on customer validation, we are open to additional marketing such as sponsorships, joint events and more.
