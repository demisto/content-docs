title: Pack Certification 
---

Certification is the process by which Cortex XSOAR validates and marks the quality of the Content Pack, free or paid. It correlates with the confidence a customer should have in the delivered content offering. Certified Packs indicate the highest level of quality and reliability in our ecosystem. Palo Alto Networks sets detailed standards for certification but see below for high level guidance.


><i>Note:</i> certification is separate from support; all Partner-submitted Packs must be supported by the Partner, regardless if the Pack is certifed or not. 


## Levels of Certification

When beginning the development process, the Contributor specifies the certification level they intend to achieve, and this will dictate the tasks the Contributor must complete. 

- Not Certified: The Pack has gone through full security testing and basic functionality testing by Palo Alto Networks.

- Certified: The Pack has gone through full security testing and full functionality testing including full coding standards, best practices check, documentation review and a demonstration. Recertification requirements to ensure retention of quality shall apply (see below).

It is up to Palo Alto Networks at its discretion to mark a piece of content with a specific certification.


## Guidance

All Paid packs <b>must</b> be certified. And if a paid Pack has dependencies on another Pack from the same Partner, that other Pack must also be certified. Since those dependant Packs work together, the whole "solution" must be certified. 

We encourage our Partners to achieve certification as this will up-level the quality of content in our ecosystem. 


## Requirements

While we encourage certified Packs, Certification has additional requirements including:

1. Mutual customers - At least two documented mutual customers requesting the Pack 

1. Full functionality testing — partners must ensure full Pack compatibility with future versions of Cortex XSOAR via a self-certify process. This process shall occur with all major and minor release of Cortex XSOAR (3-4/yr) and include each component of the Pack. 

1. Documentation — full documentation for the entire pack reviewed by Palo Alto Networks. 

1. Mature use cases and content — including full coverage of Partner’s APIs and features; playbooks to allow customers to demonstrate the value, layouts to highlight fields, etc. 

1. Coding best practices — adherence to best practices for coding standards and a deeper inspection of code. 

1. Partner product access - in order for us to validate the pack functionality. 


## Benefits

A certified pack has benefits, too:

1. Has the customer's full confidence in the quality and functionality of the Pack.

1. Receives visual highlighting to draw users' attention to the Pack.

1. More easily found via filters to show only certified Packs.

1. Elevated priority interaction with the Cortex XSOAR technical teams.
