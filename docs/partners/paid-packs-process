# Paid Pack Process

The process for submitting a paid pack on XSOAR differs slightly from that of a free pack but our Partner Success Team will help you through the whole way.

## 1. Sign the Terms & Conditions document

All publishers who wish to contribute paid content must have a 2pg additional document executed by both parties. This document defines a few additional terms to the Technology Partner Agreement including taxes, invoicing, revenue share, etc. It will be executed via DocuSign and we do not accept redlines. 

## 2. Complete Vendor Onboarding

In order for us to pay the revenue share, publishers of paid packs must complete Palo Alto Networks vendor onboarding. This process is simple, but must be completed correctly and begins with a form and then communications with our Onboarding team via email and our secure portal. 

## 3. Establish Private Repository

Paid packs are not stored in the XSOAR open source repository but instead in the publisher's own, private GitHub repo. We'll help you [set it up](/packs/premium_packs). 

## 4. Build Paid Pack(s)

Build the content for the paid packs. 

- If you're submitting a premium content pack, add the dashboards, playbooks, etc. as you would normally. 
- If you're submitting a resell pack, the pack is mostly empty except for some basic metadata files. 

## 5. Open a Pull Request on Private Repo

In order for us to review the content and add to Marketplace, we must receive a pull request and access as detailed on our page. 


That's mostly it! If you're interested in submitting premium content on our Marketplace, please <a href="mailto:soar.alliances@paloaltonetworks.com">Contact the Partner Success Team</a> today.
