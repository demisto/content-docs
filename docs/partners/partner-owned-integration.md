title: Partner-Owned Integrations 
---

The next major release of our platform will include a new capability to give our technical partners much more control over their own integrations. We call it a Partner-Owned Integration (POI) and there are a number of benefits for you, our partner:
- **Quicker** - You decide which release to launch your integration and when to update your integration: you can closely align it with your product release, with specific industry events, based on customer demand, etc. No longer do you have to rely on our roadmap and release planning. (We push releases every two weeks and you can target any release you choose.) 
- **Features** - You decide what features add the most value to your customers - after all, you know your customers and use cases better than anyone. 
- **Visibility** - You receive direct feedback from our mutual users in the form of defects and feature enhancements; you’re free to update your content whenever you like (see #1)
You are not required to give us access to your product if you don’t want to.

We’ve made launching a POI seamless and easy:

1. New partners apply at our registration page at demisto.pan.dev and follow the normal process to [become a technical partner](become-a-tech-partner). (Existing partners skip this step.) Be sure to sign up for [TSANet](https://paloaltonetworks-nextwave.connect.tsanet.org/); that’s how our support teams will find each other.

2. When you create your integration, enter relevant support and contact information in the description field.

3. Whenever you do a Pull Request be sure to enter your partner ID (the unique ID we assigned to your company when you applied, or [contact us](mailto:soar.alliances@paloaltonetworks.com)) so we can associate your request with your product and company.

4. Our Engineering team will do an expedited review of your integration code so that it can be certified as Partner-Owned. You’ll show us a Zoom demo but are not required to give us product access.

5. When we push your integration live to our global customers, we’ll add the “Partner” banner so all users can see it’s owned and managed by you! (For launch partners who created integrations in the past, we’ll update the listing to include the Partner banner automatically.)

6. Customers will send defects and enhancements directly to your company for you to prioritize and manage. (See below.)

## Support Model

Partner-Owned Integrations feature a new support model that involves the partner much more and puts them in control of the customer experience. We accomplish this in two ways:
As described above, POIs will be clearly marked with the banner. Additionally, the integration text will state that the integration is partner supported. We require the partner/owner’s contact information to be displayed there as well so the customer can easily see who to directly contact with issues/enhancements. 
We updated our support infrastructure so that we can identify and guide customers to file support tickets with the correct parties; whenever we receive a support request through our portal, we will first do basic triage to rule out platform issues. Then we'll determine if the ticket is about a POI and, if so, will lookup the contact information in TSANet and inform the user to instead open a ticket/contact the partner who owns the integration. 

## Support References

The main two documents that detail the support framework are:

1. Palo Alto Networks Technology Partner Agreement (TPA) - specifies that the partner will support what the partner writes.

2. TSANet Code of Conduct (with Addendum) - details how parties must respond across the various SLAs and severity levels.
