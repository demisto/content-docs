The Cortex XSOAR Marketplace has been successfully giving partners a vehicle in which to drive the value of their technology for over a year now. Partners develop turn-key content packs that span playbooks, dashboards, and reports and customers can subscribe to with a single click.

To take Marketplace to the next level by offering customers purchasing flexibility and giving Partners the option of ARR, the XSOAR Marketplace now supports Private Offer!

Private Offer enables Cortex XSOAR customers to subscribe to premium content packs in the XSOAR Marketplace with customized, upfront term lengths and discounts. Partners now have the ability to:
* Receive payment up front for the full contracted term
* Receive  a higher revenue share than monthly transactions
* Bundle offerings to enhance value of solution and increase revenue streams
* Meet the customer’s needs by offering longer terms and discounting flexibility on a per-deal basis
* Simplify the acquisition process by using Palo Alto Networks paper for larger, more complex deals. 
* Develop a new channel for generating revenue

Partner Benefits:
* Streamlined acquisition and activation process assures Marketplace points are being spent on the Partner’s products.
* ARR model for predictable revenue stream.
* Longer terms mean higher dollar values for the partner
* Enhance product stickiness by bundling solutions
* Increased collaboration with PANW sellers 
  * Access to unfamiliar markets and regions
  * Sell into Enterprise SOC accounts 
  * Qualified leads for solution portfolio expansion
* Amplify reach with brand alignment and marketing activities, subject to Palo Alto Networks discretion

## How does Private Offer work? 
To ensure as seamless an experience as possible for customers and partners alike, we have created a simplified process for Private Offer. XSOAR Customers have the ability to request a Private Offer directly within the XSOAR Marketplace user interface by clicking on INSERT BUTTON located in designated premium pack listings. Customers then complete a simple 5 question  Private Offer Request form. Partners who chose to participate in Private Offer will have the INSERT BUTTON activated in their pack listing. 

Requests can also be initiated through Partner sales teams or the Cortex sales teams. We highly recommend having your teams promote your XSOAR packs to ensure customers/prospects know you have a premium offering in the XSOAR Marketplace. If an opportunity is identified, email the details of the request to xsoar.privateoffer@paloaltoneworks.com. 

Here is an overview of the Private Offer process when initiated by a Partner:

## Working with the Palo Alto Networks Sellers
IN PROGRESS....

## Private Offer Agreement 
The Agreement details the terms and conditions for delivering Partner content to a specific Customer through the XSOAR Marketplace. The Agreement represents a binding contract between the Partner and Palo Alto Networks and a sample can be reviewed here (HYPERLINK THIS).

After the terms of the deal have been set and approved by the Partner, the XSOAR Partner Success Team (PST) will send the Partner a Private Offer Agreement via DocuSign. 

## Enabling Cortex Sales to sell Partner Solutions
We are invested in the success of the XSOAR Marketplace and want to help maximize our Partner’s efforts and investment in developing premium content available for Private Offer. 

On an ongoing basis, we will be running internal enablement sessions to ensure sales understands the value Partner solutions add to a customer’s XSOAR investment. To aid in enabling our sellers to promote and sell your solution we recommend creating the following:
* Sales playbook (e.g. cheat sheet) to highlight Partner solution, value prop and use cases. Here is a template to get you started.(HYPERELINK THIS)
* Joint Solution Brief (JSB)
* Please send completed playbooks and JSBs to the XSOAR PST for review: xsoar.privateoffer@paloaltonetworks.com.
