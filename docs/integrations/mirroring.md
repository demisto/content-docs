title: Mirroring Integration
---

Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0 adds support for Mirroring Integrations. These integrations allow you to mirror incidents/tickets/cases from other services.  
For example: Another XSOAR server, Cortex XDR, ServiceNow. In addition, when mapping the incident fields, mirroring enables you to pull the database schema from the integration, which brings all of the available fields into Cortex XSOAR. For more information about working with the schema, see the Select schema option described [here](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xsoar/6-0/cortex-xsoar-admin/incidents/classification-and-mapping/create-a-mapper.html).

An example mirroring integration can be seen [here](https://github.com/demisto/content/tree/master/Packs/ServiceNow/Integrations/ServiceNowv2).

Mirroring integrations are developed the same as other integrations. They provide a few extra configuration parameters and APIs.


## Supported Server Version
Mirroring is only supported from version 6.0.0 and on.


## Required Parameters
A Mirroring Integration's YAML file should have the following parameters (under the scripts section):
```yml
  isfetch: true
  ismappable: true
  isremotesyncin: true
  isremotesyncout: true
```
Where:
- isfetch determines if the integration fetches incidents.
- ismappable determines if the remote schema can be retrieved for this integration.
- isremotesyncin determines if mirroring from the 3rd party integration to XSOAR is supported.
- isremotesyncout determines if mirroring from XSOAR to the 3rd party integration is supported.

## Commands
Use the following commands to implement a mirroring integration.  
*Note that when mirroring both incoming and outgoing data, all the commands are required. For mirroring in only one direction, only some of the commands are required.*
- `test-module` - this is the command that is run when the `Test` button in the configuration panel of an integration is clicked.
- `fetch-incidents` - this is the command that fetches new incidents to Cortex XSOAR.
- `get-remote-data` - this command gets new information about the incidents in the remote system and updates *existing* incidents in Cortex XSOAR. This command is executed every 1 minute for each individual incident. 
- `update-remote-system` - this command updates the remote system with the information we have in the mirrored incidents within Cortex XSOAR. This command is executed whenever the individual incident is changed in Cortex XSOAR.
- `get-mapping-fields` - this command pulls the remote schema for the different incident types, and their associated incident fields, from the remote system. This enables users to map XSOAR fields to the 3rd-party integration fields in the outgoing mapper. 

## How to implement mirroring functions
You can implement the following functions, using the classes described below, which are globally available through the CommonServerPython file.

### get-remote-data
* GetRemoteDataArgs - this is an object created to maintain all the arguments you receive from the server in order to use this command.
Arguments explanation:
  - remote_incident_id - contains the value of the dbotMirrorId field, which represents the id of the incident in the external system.
  - last_update - the time the incident was last updated - our recommendation would be to use the arg_to_timestamp function to parse it into a timestamp.
* GetRemoteDataResponse - this is the object that maintains the format in which you should order the results from this function. You should use return_results on this object to make it work.
Arguments explanation:
  - mirrored_object - this is essentially the object(dict) of whatever you are trying to mirror - incident in most cases.
  - entries - a list of entries to add to your incident.
  
An example for such a function could be:
```python
def get_remote_data_command(client, args):
    parsed_args = GetRemoteDateArgs(args)
    new_incident_data: Dict = client.get_incident_data(parsed_args.remote_incident_id, parsed_args.last_update)    new_incident_data: Dict = client.get_incident_data(parsed_args.remote_incident_id, parsed_args.last_update)
    raw_entries: List[dict] = client.get_incident_entries(parsed_args.remote_incident_id, parsed_args.last_update)
    parsed_entries = []
    for entry in raw_entries:
        parsed_entries.append({       
            'Type': EntryType.NOTE,
            'Contents': entry.get('contents'),
            'ContentsFormat': EntryFormat.TEXT,
            'Tags': ['tag1', 'tag2'],  # the list of tags to add to the entry
            'Note': False  # boolean, True for Note, False otherwise
        })
    
    remote_incident_id = new_incident_data['incident_id']
    new_incident_data['id'] = remote_incident_id
    return GetRemoteDataResponse(new_incident_data, parsed_entries)
```

### update-remote-system
* UpdateRemoteSystemArgs - this is an object created to maintain all the arguments you receive from the server in order to use this command.
Arguments explanation:
  - data - represents the data of the current incident - a dictionary object `{key: value}`.
  - entries - represents the entries from your current incident - a list of dictionary objects representing the entries.
  - remote_incident_id - contains the value of the dbotMirrorId field, which represents the id of the incident in the external system. 
  - inc_status - the status of the incident(numeric value, could be used with IncidentStatus from CommonServerPython).
  - delta - represents the dictionary of fields which have changed from the last update - a dictionary object `{key: value}` containing only the changed fields.
  
An example for such a function could be:
```python
def update_remote_system_command(client: Client, args: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """update-remote-system command: pushes local changes to the remote system

    :type client: ``Client``
    :param client: XSOAR client to use

    :type args: ``Dict[str, Any]``
    :param args:
        all command arguments, usually passed from ``demisto.args()``.
        ``args['data']`` the data to send to the remote system
        ``args['entries']`` the entries to send to the remote system
        ``args['incidentChanged']`` boolean telling us if the local incident indeed changed or not
        ``args['remoteId']`` the remote incident id

    :return:
        ``str`` containing the remote incident id - really important if the incident is newly created remotely

    :rtype: ``str``
    """
    parsed_args = UpdateRemoteSystemArgs(args)
    if parsed_args.delta:
        demisto.debug(f'Got the following delta keys {str(list(parsed_args.delta.keys()))}')
        
    demisto.debug(f'Sending incident with remote ID [{parsed_args.remote_incident_id}] to remote system\n')
    new_incident_id: str = parsed_args.remote_incident_id
    updated_incident = {}
    if not parsed_args.remote_incident_id or parsed_args.incident_changed:
        if parsed_args.remote_incident_id:
            # First, get the incident as we need the version
            old_incident = client.get_incident(incident_id=parsed_args.remote_incident_id)
            for changed_key in parsed_args.delta.keys():
                old_incident[changed_key] = parsed_args.delta[changed_key]  # type: ignore

            parsed_args.data = old_incident

        else:
            parsed_args.data['createInvestigation'] = True

        updated_incident = client.update_incident(incident=parsed_args.data)
        new_incident_id = updated_incident['id']
        demisto.debug(f'Got back ID [{new_incident_id}]')

    else:
        demisto.debug(f'Skipping updating remote incident fields [{parsed_args.remote_incident_id}] as it is '
                      f'not new nor changed.')

    if parsed_args.entries:
        for entry in parsed_args.entries:
            demisto.debug(f'Sending entry {entry.get("id")}')
            client.add_incident_entry(incident_id=new_incident_id, entry=entry)

    # Close incident if relevant
    if updated_incident and parsed_args.inc_status == IncidentStatus.DONE:
        demisto.debug(f'Closing remote incident {new_incident_id}')
        client.close_incident(
            new_incident_id,
            updated_incident.get('version'),  # type: ignore
            parsed_args.data.get('closeReason'),
            parsed_args.data.get('closeNotes')
        )

    return new_incident_id

```
### get-mapping-fields
* SchemeTypeMapping - the object used to keep the correct structure of the mapping for the fetched incident type.
* GetMappingFieldsResponse - the object used to gather all your SchemeTypeMapping and then parse them properly into the results using the return_results command.
Usage example:
```python
def get_mapping_fields_command():
    xdr_incident_type_scheme = SchemeTypeMapping(type_name='incident type example')
    for field in ['field1', 'field2', 'field3']:
        xdr_incident_type_scheme.add_field(name=field, description='the description for the field')

    return GetMappingFieldsResponse(xdr_incident_type_scheme)

```

## Incident fields on a XSOAR incident 
The following incident fields must be configured either in the integration or the instance mapping:
* dbotMirrorDirection - valid values are Both, In, or Out.
* dbotMirrorId - represents the id of the incident in the external system.
* dbotMirrorInstance - the instance through which you will be mirroring.

Useful fields:
* dbotMirrorTags - tags for mirrored-out entries (comment/files).

## Debugging

* getMirrorStatistics command - a hidden command that returns mirroring statistics: total mirrored, rate limited, and last run.
* getSyncMirrorRecords - a hidden command that returns records that hold internal mirroring metadata for each mirrored incident
* get-remote-data - is runnable through the war room with the relevant arguments and see the results.
* get-mapping-fields - is runnable through the war room with no arguments and see the results.
