:::note
These guidelines are mainly for packs containing some use case, not a single integration.
:::

## General Guidelines
- Short and to the point
- Convey gain/benefit for user
- If possible - what is unique about this pack (e.g. minimal, extended, fast, thorough, streamlined etc.)
- Use active voice (You, yours, do, use, investigate) where possible
- Omit redundancy (Do not repeat the name of the pack, do not start with "Use thisâ€¦")
- Must respect product capitalization (e.g. Content Pack)
- Constant tense (e.g. if "Engages" than "investigates", not "investigating")
- Up to 150 chars
- Up to 4 lines

:::note
It can be challenging, and you will need to invest some extra time to get it right. (Ask for our help if needed)
