title: Pack Documentation
---

Content Packs displayed in the Cortex XSOAR Marketplace contain 2 main documentation sections: 
* **Description**: displayed in the Content Pack card when browsing the Marketplace and in the top of the *Details* tab.
* **README**: displayed in the main display area of the *Details* tab.

## Pack Description
The Pack Description is maintained in the `pack_metadata.json` file under the description field. Packs should always contain a description, even if a README file is provided with more details. This is to allow users to get a short overview of the Pack when browsing the Marketplace.

### General Description Guidelines
- Short and to the point
- Convey gain/benefit for user
- If possible - what is unique about this pack (e.g. minimal, extended, fast, thorough, streamlined etc.)
- Use active voice (You, yours, do, use, investigate) where possible
- Omit redundancy (Do not repeat the name of the pack, do not start with "Use thisâ€¦")
- Must respect product capitalization (e.g. Content Pack)
- Constant tense (e.g. if "Engages" than "investigates", not "investigating")
- Up to 150 chars
- Up to 4 lines

#### An example of turning a "fat" description into a "lean" description:
**Before** 300 chars / 44 words:  
Use this content pack to investigate and remediate a potential phishing incident. The playbook simultaneously engages with the user that triggered the incident, while investigating the incident itself and enriching the relevant IOCs.
The final remediation tasks are always decided by a human analyst.

**After** 139 chars / 10 words :  
Streamline Investigation and remediation of Phishing incidents. Playbook engages with users while simultaneously investigates and enriches.

#### An example of turning a "passive" description into a "active" description:
**Before** (passive and impersonal):  
Provides data enrichment for domains and IP addresses.

**After** (active and personal) :  
Enrichment for your domains and IP addresses.

Here are some templates that can help you get started:

* "Streamline your _______ process for  _______. Optimized for _________ and ________ this _______ targeted Content Pack is ideal for _____________"
* "Eliminate ________ by improving your__________. Rich with layouts and playbooks, this Content Pack is right for ____________"
* "Get smarter. This pack utilizes _________ and _______for when _________ is heavily needed"

## Pack README
For larger Packs that provide a use case, we recommend creating a README file which will be displayed in the *Details* tab of the Pack. The `README.md` file should be markdown formatted and placed in the Packs root directory. The file should contain a more detailed overview of the Pack compared to the *Description* section. You are free to add any information you see fit to include about the pack. It is recommended to provide an overview of what the Pack does and how to start working with the Pack.  

### README structure
- **If** the pack is a beta pack, add the following at the very beginning of the pack README file:
_Note: This is a beta pack, which lets you implement and test pre-release software. Since the pack is beta, it might contain bugs. Updates to the pack during the beta phase might include non-backward compatible features. We appreciate your feedback on the quality and usability of the pack to help us identify issues, fix them, and continually improve._
* A short paragraph connecting real life situations to the usefulness of the pack
* A "What does this pack do?" section, explaining point by point what the capabilities of the pack or the main playbook of the pack are.
* Optional: a sentence or two detailing the contents of the pack.
* Mostly relevant for use-case packs that contain multiple playbooks: a reference to the README of the **main playbook** of the pack which contains most of the logic behind it. Add the following:
_For more information, visit our Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs_
Note that "Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs" should link **directly to the readme of the main playbook**. An example of what is linked in the Phishing pack: https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/phishing-investigation---generic-v2
* For packs that contains playbooks: a youtube video or an image of the main playbook of the pack. The section following the pack image below explains how to add an image.

### Images
Images can provide a great addition to the Pack `README.md` and can help users to get a quick understanding of the Pack. For Packs that contain playbooks which implement a use case, we recommend including at least an image of the main use case playbook.  Images can be included in the same way as documented for integrations. See the [following for instructions](integration-docs#images). 


## Pack Dependencies
### What are pack dependencies?
With the introduction of Marketplace in Cortex XSOAR, the user now chooses what content they want to install and use, and that content appears in the form of Content Packs.
Pack dependencies are the requirement of one content pack, when using another pack. The implication of this is that a userin XSOAR has to install another pack to be able to use the pack they originally wish installed. That situation is generally and preferably avoidable.

Dependencies can be categorized as either optional or required/mandatory. Optional means the pack will **benefit** from the existence of the pack it depends on, while required means the pack **needs**, and **will not work correctly** without the existence of the pack it depends on.
Some packs ship out-of-the-box with XSOAR, and so depending on them is absolutely fine. Such are the Core packs:
