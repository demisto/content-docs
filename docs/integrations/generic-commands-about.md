## About Generic Commands

Today the current XSOAR platform supports over 450+ integrations. 
Some commands can be generalized across similar integrations and allow combining data from various sources or running in parallel on more than one integration:

* Reputation commands for example `!file` can gather reputation from multiple connected integrations to one indicator.

These commands can be used both on all integrations or with `using` parameter on a specific instance of an integration.
