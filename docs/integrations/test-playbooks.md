title: Test Playbooks
---

We use Test Playbooks to test our integrations and automation scripts. The Test Playbooks provide full *End to End* testing. For testing small units of code, use [Unit Testing](unit-testing). 

Tests are run using our CI framework. They are run both as part of the build process and on a nightly basis. If you are a contributor, during the initial PR, Test Playbooks will not run but they will be used as part of the review process. Once the PR is merged into a `contrib/*` branch by one of the team members and credentials (if needed) are provided to Cortex XSOAR, the test playbooks will be run as part of our CI framework. 

**Note:** Test Playbooks are required as part of the PR acceptance review process. For simple Scripts that have unit tests, a test playbook is optional.

A Test Playbook consists of several steps, including testing commands, verifying the results, and closing the investigation.

We use a standard naming convention for our playbook tests which follows the format below:

```Integration_Name-Test```

## Auto-Generate a Test Playbook
To auto generate a Test playbook based upon an integration or script use the following `demisto-sdk generate-test-playbook` command which can be found [here](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk#generate-test-playbook). You can then import the playbook and modify it to your needs.

## Manually Create a Test Playbook
1. Navigate to **Playbooks** and click **New Playbook**.
2. Define a **Playbook name**.


### Add DeleteContext
When creating a Test Playbook, it is often recommended for the first step to be **DeleteContext**. "Delete Context" does just that, it deletes all of the context data. While not always vital, it ensures that a test playbook has a clean beginning to test from without conflicting data. Especially, useful while developing and you wish to re-run the playbook. This allows for a test to be "sterile" and can help us to eliminate unrelated issues from the test.

1. In the search field, type **deletecontext** and click **Utilities**.
2. In the **DeleteContext** task, click **Add**.
3. From the dropdown menu in the **all** field, select **yes**.
4. Click **OK** and connect the **Playbook Triggered** task to the **DeleteContext** task.

## Testing a Command, Verifying the Results, and Closing an Investigation

It's important to test as many commands of the integration as possible as tasks, and each command should have a task. For this example we will look at the integration **IPInfo**, which accepts only one command called `!ip`.

### Test a Command

1. Navigate to **Playbooks** and click **New Playbook**.
2. In the search field, type **ipinfo** and click **ip**.
3. In the **ip** task, click **Add** to edit the configuration options.
4. Select an entity that will produce the most *consistent* results in the *ip* field, such as 8.8.8.8, the Google DNS server.
5. Click **OK** to save your changes.
6. Finally, connect the starting **DeleteContext** task to the **ip** task.

### Verify the Command Results
After you build the command, verify that you have received the results that you expect:

1. Open the **Task Library** and select **Create Task**.
2. Configure the new task.

| Configuration | Action |
| ---- | ----| 
| **Conditional** | Select the **Conditional** button to display the condition options. |
| **Task Name** | Type a task name. |
| **From previous tasks** |  Click **{}** to display the **Select source for** tool. The **Select source for** tool displays the **#2 ip** task that you created. |
| **2 ip** | Click to display the **ip** task configurations. |
| **IP** | Click **Address** and click **Close**. The `IP.Address` is displayed in the **From previous tasks** field. This is the Context Path. |
| **From previous tasks** | Wrap the Context Path using this format `${IP.Address}`. Wrapping the Context Path tells Cortex XSOAR to retrieve the value located in the curly brackets. |
| **As value** | Type 8.8.8.8 and click âœ…. |

**Note:** If you need to edit the value in a field, you can click on the value and edit it. For example, click on the value in the **From previous tasks** field and edit the `${IP.Address}` value.

3. Optional: If you need to filter or format the result, click **Filters and Operations** located in the **Select source for** dialog box.
4. Click **Save**.
5. Connect the **ip** task to the **Verify Command Results** task.

### Close the Investigation
1. Navigate to **Playbooks** and click **New Playbook**.
2. In the search field, type **closeinvestigation** and click **BuiltIn Commands**.
3. For **closeInvestigation**, click **Add**.
4. Click the **{}** in the *id* field.
5. Click **Incident details** and find **ID**. `${incident.id}` is inserted into the **id** field.
6. Click **Close** and click **OK**.
7. Connect the **Verify Command Results** task to the **closeInvestigation** task.
8. Choose the **yes** label name for the condition and click **Save**.

### Naming and Exporting the Playbook
Cortex XSOAR uses a standard naming convention for playbook tests that follows this format: `Integration_Name-Test`.

1. Click **Save Version**.
2. Exit the playbook editor.
3. Export the playbook by clicking ![download button](../doc_imgs/integrations/50277516-4d74bd80-044d-11e9-94b6-5195dd0db796.png).

## Adding the Playbook to your Project
1. Save your newly created test playbook to the `TestPlaybooks` directory in your pack.
2. In the playbook YAML file that you created, edit the `id` so that it is identical to the `name` field.
3. Modify the value in the `version` field to *-1* to prevent user changes.
4. Using the example above, the top of your YAML should look like this:

```yml
id: IPInfo-Test
version: -1
name: IPInfo-Test
```

## Adding Tests to conf.json
In order to associate integrations with a test plabyook we mange a `conf.json` file (at the root of the repository). The conf.json file is located in the **Tests** directory.

The following is an example of a correct conf.json entry for an integration:
```yml
        {
            "integrations": "Forcepoint",
            "playbookID": "forcepoint test",
            "timeout": 500,
            "nightly": true
        },
```
The following table describes the fields:

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
| **integrations** | The ID of the integration that you are testing. |
| **playbookID** | The ID of the test playbook that you are running. |
| **timeout** | The time in seconds to extend the timeout to (optional). |
| **nightly** | Boolean that indicates if the test should be part of **only** the nightly tests (optional). |
