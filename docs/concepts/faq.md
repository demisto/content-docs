### Which IDEs do you support?
- We have [PyCharm plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12093-demisto-add-on-for-pycharm)
- You can develop integrations and scripts in Cortex XSOAR
- Playbooks can only be developed in Cortex XSOAR.

### Which Python version you support?
Cortex XSOAR supports both Python2 and Python3. For new contributions we require Python3.

### Can I develop in JavaScript?
Cortex XSOAR supports JavaScript integrations and scripts. Our preferred development language is Python, and all new integrations and scripts should be developed in Python, which also provides a wider set of capabilities compared to the available JavaScript support. Simple scripts may still be developed in JavaScript.

### Which OSs are supported for development?
Our recommended OS for development is either macOS or Linux, as we use bash and docker in some of our validation/testing flows.

If you are working on Windows, you can either work with a Linux VM or utilize [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

### Licensing
Cortex XSOAR content repository has a [MIT License](https://github.com/demisto/content/blob/master/LICENSE).
