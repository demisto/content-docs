In this section we captured some of the Design Best practices that you should consider when building an integration.
Remember, it's important to keep it simple - each command/API call at its time.

Follow the [Contribution Design](../tutorials/tut-design) tutorial for more details.

If you have any doubts or questions, please reach out to us over [Slack](https://dfircommunity.slack.com).

**Design Best Practices:**

**Integration categories:**

Make sure your integration is categorized correctly by choosing one of the following:

Import events as incidents
Threat Intel Feeds
Analytics & SIEM
Authentication
Data Enrichment & Threat Intelligence
Database
Endpoint
Forensics & Malware Analysis
Messaging
Utilities
Vulnerability Management

Use cases can be helpful for the categorization as well as looking for similar integrations to the one you are working on.


**Product platform:**

An important parameter to take into consideration in the design is the integrated product platform: SaaS product, on-prem, or both? Make sure to support both if needed. The platform type can have a major impact on authentication methods and possibly different API (parameters/outputs).


**Data clarity:**

The data returned to the analyst should be as clear as possible, for example you should convert Epoch timestamps, decrypt data if necessary, etc. If you return IDs, make sure to return the original asset name, category type, group name, etc. Additionally, make sure the parameters and command descriptions are as descriptive as possible; users should be able to understand what the command does and any argument/paramater defaults, maximums, minimums, and so on.
Stay as true to your product as possible: keep the same names as used by your product, the UI is a good baseline for what the human readable should look like



**DBot score:**

When mapping a score to DBot score, stay as close as possible to the integrated product scoring thresholds and categorization (these are usually documented or can be found in the UI of the integrated product). DBot score reputation includes the following scores:
0 – unknown
1 – good
2 – suspicious
3 – bad
Give users a threshold argument to enable customers to override and implement alternate scoring logic. Specify the score thresholds and DBot score mapping to the integration documentation.

Check the top [Use Cases](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/concepts/use-cases). If those are supported via api make sure to include them in the integration.
Make sure to set generic commands that will indicate the entity reputation such as “!url,ip,file,domain,hash”.
When adding or removing indicators, define a message to the indicator timeline. The message should be as the following: ***The indicator was added to XXX***. See [Demisto Results](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/integrations/code-conventions#deprecated---demistoresults).



**Global Context:**

Global Context outputs are important, when an analyst will execute commands/playbooks it will give them the option to receive information from multiple integrated products. Additionally, don’t forget [global context outputs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/integrations/code-conventions#deprecated---demistoresults) for DBot scoring and global indicators.


**Commands:**

Use the following naming convention for commands: ***PRODUCTNAME-OBJECTNAME-ACTION***. In this structure, this will make it easier for the analyst to find the right object in the UI.

Command arguments should be snake case and lower case i.e. ***argument_name***

Polling playbook & check status command – If the command can take more than a few seconds to execute (vulnerability scan, complex query, file detonation in sandbox, etc) make sure to add a [polling playbook](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/playbooks/generic-polling). If implemented, do remember to include a “status” command as well.

Time arguments – When the command supports filtering results by time, use start and end time parameters (if supported by UI), and a timeframe parameter, that accepts inputs such as “4 days ago”, “5 minutes ago”, etc.


**Backward compatibility:**

Don’t break it! XOSAR components, such as playbooks, rely on previous inputs. Here are a few suggested workarounds to avoid breaking backward compatibility: keep the old context, add new paths as needed and update the outputs accordingly, if a command needs major modifications, deprecate the command and create a new one.

**Limitations:**

- Logo must be under 10kb. Make sure to use the company logo ( not the product’s).
- Context limitation, If the result contains more than 50 entries, limit the context size.
