- The participants who will take part of the demo are the contributor, the PR reviewer, and based on the content of the PR a security reviewer as well.
- The demo should take up to an hour (based on the PR size).

### Pre Demo
- Make sure the change requests from your code review are fully addressed and fixed.
- Prepare an XSOAR instance that has all the recent changes and has the most updated version of your pack, the demo will be performed in this environment.
### Demo Agenda and Workflow:
The following may change given the scope and the size of the contribution.
- Product overview - short general explanation about the product.
- Overview of the Use-cases implemented in the pack - which cases are those the customer will use the pack for.
