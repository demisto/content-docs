This is a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the contributor and the Cortex XSOAR team. This document identifies the services required and the expected level of services.

#### There are three options for contributing content to the Cortex XSOAR marketplace:

   1. Contribute from the Cortex XSOAR UI - for more information please see [Contributing through the Marketplace](../contributing/marketplace).
   
   2. Contribute through a GitHub Pull Request on the public [XSOAR Content Repository](https://github.com/demisto/content) - for more information please see [Contributing docs](../contributing/contributing).

   3. Contribute through a private GitHub repository: this is required if you are providing a **Premium** (aka Paid) Content Pack - for more information please see [here](../packs/premium_packs).
   

In each of the above options, the review phase will begin with the **opening of the GitHub Pull Request** containing your content changes.

#### Once your PR is open, the XSOAR team commits to the following:

   1. A reviewer will be assigned to your PR within an **hour** after opening it.
   
   2. Your reviewer will publish his initial response to your changes within **5 business days**.
   
   3. If you were required to make changes to the code, you have made the necessary changes, and have updated about it in a message on the PR - your reviewer will respond within **3 business days**.



#### In order for the contribution process to be successful, the cortex XSAOR team requires the following from the contributors:

   1. Provide the cortex XSOAR team with as much information as possible about the changes you made or about the new content you created.
