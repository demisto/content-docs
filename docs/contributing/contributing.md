Thanks for being interested in contributing to Cortex XSOAR. This document describes the Contribution process.

Contributing allows you to make the content that you build on Cortex XSOAR available to every client through the  [Marketplace](../partners/marketplace). Content can be either Partner or Community supported, [Free or Paid](../partners/marketplace#pricing).

All the free content (i.e. everything excluding Paid Content Packs) is open source and lives in the Cortex XSOAR [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/demisto/content), with a MIT license.

After you have created your content, you must submit your content for our team to review and approve.

There are three ways to submit your work:
 - In the majority of the cases and you want to provide a Content Pack that you want to support, you must open a GitHub Pull Request.
 - Starting from version 6.0, Cortex XSOAR supports a [simplified flow](../contributing/marketplace) to Contribute directly from the product UI: use this flow only if you are an individual contributor and your Content Pack is going to be community supported.
 - Only if you are providing a Premium (aka Paid) Content Pack, the GitHub process is slightly different and is described [here](../integrations/premium_packs).

 This document describes the main flow that covers most of the cases and summarizes everything you must do before and after opening a Pull Request on GitHub to contribute your pack.

Before proceeding, sure to check the content contribution [checklist](../contributing/checklist) to make sure you have created everything you need.

## Before opening a Pull Request

Before opening the Pull Request on the Cortex XSOAR [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/demisto/content), you need to:

- Have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account that you'll use to open the Pull Request
- If you're an XSOAR partner, have your `partner-id` (this should have been communicated to you over the onboarding emails from the Alliance team).
- Join our our [Slack DFIR Community](https://www.demisto.com/community/), also useful if you have questions (use the `#demisto-developers` channel).
- Design Document: we encourage you to prepare a Design Document that describes the capabilities of your Pack. Usually it's a Google Doc shared with you by the Alliances team. Click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wETtBEKg37PHNU8tYeB56M1LE314ux086z3HFeF_cX0) to see a compiled example of a Design Document.
- Create a short video to demo your product and your pack, and link it: this will be used by our reviewers to understand what your product does and how the content pack work.
- Pass the linters `demisto-sdk lint`: if you have an Integration or Script, your code must pass the [tests](../tutorials/tut-setup-dev#step-5-run-the-linter-and-unit-tests).
- Pass the validation `demisto-sdk validate`: make sure you run `demisto-sdk validate -i Packs/YourPackName` and all the checks are passed before opening the Pull Request. If unsure, ask for help on the `#demisto-developers` channel on our [Slack DFIR Community](https://www.demisto.com/community/).

## After opening a Pull Request

After opening the Pull Request, make sure that you:

- Sign the [CLA](https://github.com/demisto/content/blob/master/docs/cla.pdf): every contributor must sign our Contributor License Agreement in order for their contribution to be added to our content.
- Monitor your Pull Request on GitHub and be ready for a demo: our Content team will add comments to the Pull Request, asking questions and requesting changes. At some point, we'll ask you to schedule a meeting to see an interactive demo, make sure you have a working installation of Cortex XSOAR with your pack fully configured.

More details on the review process and valdiation steps are availble on [GitHub](https://github.com/demisto/content/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### For Certified packs only:
- Provide us credentials for a test environment: if your Pack includes an integration, we'll need credentials (i.e. API keys) to access a SaaS test/demo environment of your Product from Cortex XSOAR in order to run our nightly build. Please work with your Palo Alto Networks alliance team contact to securely provide such credentials to us.
