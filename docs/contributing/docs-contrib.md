Our developer docs and reference Content docs are open source and hosted on GitHub. We've integrated the editing experience via GitHub directly into our docs site to make it even easier to contribute and suggest improvements.

## Editing an Existing Document
To fix small errors and omissions in existing documents we recommend editing the document directly via a pull request (PR). While you can create an issue to report the error, it is often faster and easier to simply edit the document with the suggested fix via a pull request.

1. For most pages you will see an `Edit this Page` option at the bottom of the page.

    **Note:** if the `Edit this page` option is not available, it means the page is not open for public contribution. Feel free to still report an issue.

2. Once the `Edit this page` link is clicked, a new window from GitHub will open up. The window will contain the page in markdown view with an option to edit the page. Click the `Pencil` icon to start editing the page.

   **Note:** If the pencil icon is grayed out, you need to log in to your GitHub account or if necessary create a new account.
