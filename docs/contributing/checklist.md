title: Contribution Checklist
---

This document includes a checklist that summarizes the list of files that you need in order to [contribute](../contributing/contributing) to the Cortex XSOAR content repository. Please make sure you have everything before you open a Pull Request (unless stated otherwise).

Keep in mind that content packs can contain multiple types of entities, such as Integrations, Automations (Scripts), Playbooks, Incident Types, Incident Fields, and so on.

Happy contributing!

## Content Pack Checklist

No matter what you include in your content pack, the pack must include the following:

- Pack Metadata file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/pack_metadata.json`) : the information about your content pack. It should be compiled with all the required information, as explained [here](../integrations/packs-format).
- Pack README (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/README.md`): the readme of the pack file. More information [here](../documentation/pack-docs).
- Release Notes (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/ReleaseNotes/1_0_1.md`): these are required only if you are updating an existing Content pack, not for the first. More information [here](../documentation/release-notes).

**Note**: Please use PascalCase (YourPackName) for the names of the directories and files that include your company, integration and playbook names (see the examples below).

As a reference, you can check the tree of the [Hello World](https://github.com/demisto/content/tree/master/Packs/HelloWorld) pack on GitHub.

To create a new content pack directory tree and structure, you should use the [`demisto-sdk init`](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk/tree/master/demisto_sdk/commands/init#init) , as described in the [tutorial](../tutorials/tut-setup-dev#step-6-create-a-branch-and-integration-directory).

### Where do I get all these files?

Integrations and Scripts should be written with your favorite IDE (see [here](../concepts/dev-setup) and [here](../tutorials/tut-setup-dev) for details on how to set up your dev environment)

All other entity types (Playbooks, Test Playbooks, Incidents/Indicators Fields and Types, Layouts, Classifiers and Mappers, Widgets, Dashboards) should be created in the Cortex XSOAR UI and exported using [`demisto-sdk download`](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk/tree/master/demisto_sdk/commands/download#download) (using the `-fmt` argument). You can also export the files manually via the Cortex XSOAR UI (either individually using the download icons, or using the `Export Custom Content` feature under `Settings` - `About` - `Troubleshooting`) but, in that case, you'll need to format them using [`demisto-sdk format`](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk/blob/master/demisto_sdk/commands/format/README.md).

###  Integrations

If your pack contains an Integration, the integration directory should contain the following:

- Code file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/Integrations/YourIntegrationName/YourIntegrationName.py`): your integration implementation [code](../integrations/code-conventions).
-  YML file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/Integrations/YourIntegrationName/YourIntegrationName.yml`): [YML file](../integrations/yaml-file) with integration metadata.
- Description file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/Integrations/YourIntegrationName/YourIntegrationName_description.md`): markdown file with instructions on how a customer can configure the integration instance. It shows up as a snippet when the user clicks the question mark icon in the integration configuration panel. More details [here](../documentation/integration-description).
- Image file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/Integrations/YourIntegrationName/YourIntegrationName_image.png`): the integration [logo](../integrations/integration-logo).
- README file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/Integrations/YourIntegrationName/README.md`): the integration documentation, mostly autogenerated (see [here](../documentation/readme_file)).
- Command examples file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/Integrations/YourIntegrationName/command_examples`): are needed to [autogenerate](../documentation/readme_file#command-examples) the documentation
- Unit tests file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/Integrations/YourIntegrationName/YourIntegrationName_test.py`): must be included to automatically test the code during the review phase. More details [here](../integrations/unit-testing)
- Unit tests data (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/Integrations/YourIntegrationName/test_data/*.json`): contain example responses from your product API and are used in [Unit tests](../integrations/unit-testing). [Examples](https://github.com/demisto/content/tree/master/Packs/HelloWorld/Integrations/HelloWorld/test_data) from Hello World.
- Custom Incident Types, Fields, Classifiers, Mappers and Layouts: **if** your integration has the ability to [*fetch incidents*](../integrations/fetching-incidents), most likely you need to provide custom Incident Types and the related entities. This is usually covered during the Design phase: work with your Palo Alto Networks alliance contact if in doubt.

**Note**: if you use PowerShell and not Python, the extension of the code files will be `.ps1` instead of `.py`.


... and of course your adherence to our best practices and [code conventions](../integrations/code-conventions) will be evaluated in a stricter way.

### Playbooks

If your pack contains at least a playbook, the playbook directory must contain the following files:

- Playbook file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/Playbooks/playbook-YourPlaybookName.yml`): if exported directly from the XSOAR UI, it must be formatted with `demisto-sdk format`.
- README file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/Playbooks/playbook-YourPlaybookName_README.md`): documentation file for the Playbook, mostly [autogenerated](../documentation/readme_file#creating-documentation)
- Image file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/doc_files/YourPlaybookName.png`): image of the Playbook as exported from the XSOAR UI. Its link should be added to the README file as explained [here](../documentation/readme_file#images)

*Note*: the playbook README file must be updated with the correct image link after the Pull Request is opened, as explained in the documentation [here](../documentation/readme_file#images)

### Incident or Indicator Fields

If your pack contains at least a custom Incident or Indicator field, you'll need:

- Incident or Indicator field JSON file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/IncidentFields/YourIncidentFieldName.json` or `Packs/YourPackName/IndicatorFields/YourIndicatorFieldName.json`): if exported directly from the XSOAR UI, it must be formatted with `demisto-sdk format`.

:::note
- You will need a single JSON file for each field (individual files are created automatically if you export your content via `demisto-sdk download` or through the `Export Custom Content` option under `Settings` - `About` - `Troubleshooting`).
- It is best practice not to associate a field to all types, but only to the relevant ones (e.g., if you added an incident type, for events fetched from a third-party product, and incident fields to contain details of the event, associate those fields only to that incident type).
:::

### Incident or Indicator Types

If your pack contains at least a custom Incident or Indicator type, you'll need:

- Incident or Indicator type JSON file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/IncidentTypes/YourIncidentTypeName.json` or `Packs/YourPackName/IndicatorType/YourIndicatorTypeName.json`): if exported directly from the XSOAR UI, it must be formatted with `demisto-sdk format`.

If you have a custom Incident or Indicator type, most probably you'll also have to include corresponding *Classifiers*, *Mappers* and *Layouts*:

### Classifiers and Mappers

- Classifier JSON file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/Classifiers/classifier-YourIntegrationName.json`): if exported directly from the XSOAR UI, it must be formatted with `demisto-sdk format`. If exported from Cortex XSOAR 5.x, it must also be [converted](../incidents/incident-classification-mapping#classifier--mapper-files-structure) to 6.0 format.
- Mapper JSON file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/Classifiers/classifier-mapper-incoming-YourIntegrationName.json`): if exported directly from the XSOAR UI, it must be formatted with `demisto-sdk format`. If exported from Cortex XSOAR 5.x, it must also be [converted](../incidents/incident-classification-mapping#classifier--mapper-files-structure) to 6.0 format.

If you want your pack to be also compatible with version 5.x of Cortex XSOAR (5.0 and 5.5), you'll also need:

- 5.x Classifier & Mapper JSON file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/Classifiers/classifier-YourIntegrationName_5_9_9.json`)

### Incidents or Indicator Layouts

- Layout JSON file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/Layouts/layoutscontainer-YourIncidentTypeName.json`): if exported directly from the XSOAR UI, it must be formatted with `demisto-sdk format`. If exported from Cortex XSOAR 5.x, it must also be [converted](../incidents/incident-customize-incident-layout#layout-file-structure) to 6.0 format.

If you want your pack to be also compatible with version 5.x of Cortex XSOAR (5.0 and 5.5), you'll also need:

- 5.x Layout JSON File (one file for each Layout type, i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/Layouts/layouts-details-YourIncidentTypeName.json`)

###  Scripts (Automations)

If your pack contains at least an automation script, the automation directory should contain the following:

- Code file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/YourScriptName/Scripts/YourScriptName.py`): your script implementation [code](../integrations/code-conventions).
- YML file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/Scripts/YourScriptName/YourScriptName.yml`): YML file with [script metadata](../integrations/yaml-file).
- README  file (`Packs/YourPackName/Scripts/YourScriptName/README.md`): the script  documentation, mostly autogenerated (see [here](../documentation/readme_file)).
- Unit tests file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/Scripts/YourScriptName/YourScriptName_test.py`): must be included to automatically test the code during the review phase. More details [here](../integrations/unit-testing)
- Unit tests data files (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/Scripts/YourScriptName/test_data/*.json`): contain example responses from your product API and are used in [Unit tests](../integrations/unit-testing).

**Note**: if you use PowerShell and not Python, the extension of the code files will be `.ps1` instead of `.py`.

... and of course your adherence to our best practices and [code conventions](../integrations/code-conventions) will be evaluated in a stricter way.

**Note**: if your pack contains both integrations and scripts, you can use a single Test Playbook to test both.

### Widgets

If your pack contains at least a custom widget, you'll need:

- Widget JSON file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/Widgets/widget-YourWidgetName.json`): if exported directly from the XSOAR UI, it must be formatted with `demisto-sdk format`.

### Dashboards

If your pack contains at least a custom dashboard, you'll need:

- Dashboard JSON file (i.e. `Packs/YourPackName/Dashboard/dashboard-YourDashboardName.json`): if exported directly from the XSOAR UI, it must be formatted with `demisto-sdk format`.

:::note
New contributed content packs, should have all their available content entities supported from Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0.
For example, in a YAML file (integration/script) the version can be set as described [here](../integrations/yaml-file#version-and-tests).
