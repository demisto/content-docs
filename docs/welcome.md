## About Cortex XSOAR

Cortex XSOAR's security orchestration and automation enables standardized, automated, and coordinated response across your security product stack. Playbooks powered by thousands of security actions make scalable, accelerated incident response a reality. On this site you will learn the ins and outs of Cortex XSOAR's development platform so you can begin to create content and integrations.

## Developer Documentation

The Cortex XSOAR Developer Hub is organized in different sections to guide you through the process of creating a successful Cortex XSOAR contribution. Start with the [Getting Started](concepts/getting-started-guide) section to understand the Cortex XSOAR concepts, the Contribution process, and to set up a development environment.

On the left sidebar you'll find documentation for all the different things you can build: start with [Content Packs](integrations/packs-format) that represent the backbone of every contribution then, depending on what you want to create, explore the other sections accordingly: **Integrations & Scripts**, **Playbooks**, **Incidents, Fields & Layouts**.

Finally, the **Tutorials** section includes longer end-to-end articles that guide you through a specific process (i.e. design).
