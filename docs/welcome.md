Playbooks powered by thousands of security actions make scalable, accelerated incident response a reality. On this site you will learn the ins and outs of Cortex XSOAR's development platform so you can begin to create content and integrations.

## Developer Documentation

The Cortex XSOAR Developer Hub is organized in different sections to guide you through the process of creating a successful Cortex XSOAR contribution. Start with the [Getting Started](integrations/getting-started-guide) section to understand the Cortex XSOAR concepts, the Contribution process, and to set up a development environment.

On the left sidebar you'll find documentation for all the different things you can build: start with [Content Packs](integrations/packs-format) that represent the backbone of every contribution then, depending on what you want to create, explore the other sections accordingly: **Integrations & Scripts**, **Playbooks**, **Incidents, Fields & Layouts**.

Finally, the **Tutorials** section includes longer end-to-end articles that guide you through a specific process (i.e. design).
