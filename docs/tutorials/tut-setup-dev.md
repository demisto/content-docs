title: Set Up Your Dev Environment
---

This tutorial will guide you on how to set up your dev environment to quickly start developing on Cortex XSOAR. While in Cortex XSOAR you can write code directly in the UI, which is awesome, you'll need a proper development environment external to Cortex XSOAR to contribute a full integration. This is because, in order to build a full fledged integration, you'll need to *lint* your code, run unit tests with *pytest*, create some documentation, submit your changes via *git* and more.

If you've been through this process already and just want a quick reference, you can jump to the [Development Setup](../concepts/dev-setup) page, otherwise keep reading for more details.

This tutorial will guide you through the following steps:

1. Verify the requirements
2. Fork the GitHub repo
3. Clone the GitHub fork locally
4. Set up the environment
5. Run the linter and unit tests
6. Create a branch and integration directory
7. Commit and push

### Step 1: Verify the requirements

Let's go make sure that all the requirements are satisfied, one by one.

#### Cortex XSOAR

We are assuming that Cortex XSOAR is already installed. For more information about installing Cortex XSOAR please refer to [this article](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xsoar/6-0/cortex-xsoar-admin/installation.html) (Support Center credentials are required)

Check if your Cortex XSOAR License is correctly installed by navigating to *Settings* -> *ABOUT* -> *License* and make sure that everything is green:

![Check Cortex XSOAR License](/doc_imgs/tutorials/tut-setup-dev/01-checkdemistolicense.gif)

**PRO tip**: you can quickly navigate to different pages within Cortex XSOAR by hitting *Ctrl-K* and then typing what you want. For the license page, for example, type */settings/license* or just *lic* and select the autocompleted option:

![Jump to Page](/doc_imgs/tutorials/tut-setup-dev/02-jumptopage.png)


#### GitHub

Not much to check here, just go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and make sure that you have an account or Sign Up for one:

![GitHub](/doc_imgs/tutorials/tut-setup-dev/03-github.png)


#### Docker

Make sure that `docker` is installed on your system and is working correctly by running the `hello-world` container:

```bash
sb@dddd:~/demisto$ docker run --rm hello-world

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

[... output omitted for brevity ...]

For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/

sb@dddd:~/demisto$
```

*Note:* If you are using Windows with WSL2, you can still use Docker Desktop from WSL. Follow this [tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/#enabling-docker-support-in-wsl-2-distros) for details.

Great, all the prerequisites are set! We can get started.

### Step 2: Fork the GitHub repo

Make sure you're logged on GitHub and navigate to the [Cortex XSOAR Content Repo](https://github.com/demisto/content) and click on **Fork**:

![Fork Repository](../doc_imgs/tutorials/tut-setup-dev/04-fork.png)

Once the fork is complete, copy the URL:

![Copy GitHub URL](../doc_imgs/tutorials/tut-setup-dev/05-copygithuburl.png)

This is the fork where you will commit your code and, once ready, create the Pull Request to submit your contribution back to the Cortex XSOAR Content repository.

### Step 3: Clone the GitHub fork locally

Back to the shell, create a folder (in the tutorial we'll use `~/demisto`) and clone your fork of the content repository using `git clone [your_fork_url]`, where `[your_fork_url]` is the URL you copied from GitHub in the previous step:

```bash
sb@dddd:~$ mkdir demisto
sb@dddd:~$ cd demisto
sb@dddd:~/demisto$ git clone https://github.com/[omitted]/content.git
Cloning into 'content'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 108, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (108/108), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (90/90), done.
remote: Total 101143 (delta 50), reused 53 (delta 18), pack-reused 101035
Receiving objects: 100% (101143/101143), 110.65 MiB | 11.04 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (73634/73634), done.
Checking out files: 100% (4522/4522), done.
sb@dddd:~/demisto$
```

*Note:* You must clone **your fork** of the repository, as you will need to be able to write into it. Do **not** clone `demisto/content`, as you won't be able to push commits.

### Step 4: Setup environment

#### Option 1: Setup a remote environment

Follow the instructions in this [guide](tut-setup-dev-remote.md).

#### Option 2: Setup a local environment

##### Operating System

We assume you have an operating system and that it is working. :)

*Note:* If you are using **Windows with WSL**, and your code resides in a shared folder on the Windows tree (i.e., `/mnt/c/code/demisto`), make sure that the folder is set to be [case sensitive](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/improved-per-directory-case-sensitivity-support-in-wsl/).

##### Python and pyenv

You will need `python3` installed on your system. We recommend using `pyenv`. At the time of this writing, the latest version of Python 3.10 is *3.10.5*.

Make sure `pyenv` in installed and that the `eval "$(pyenv init -)"` expression is placed in your shell configuration (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) - [more information about this](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation).

```bash
sb@dddd:~/demisto$ eval "$(pyenv init -)"
sb@dddd:~/demisto$ pyenv -v
pyenv 1.2.15
sb@dddd:~/demisto$~/demisto$
```
If this doesn't work, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation). Either Homebrew for MacOS or the automatic installer on Linux/WSL works fine.

Make sure that the required version of Python is available:

```bash
sb@dddd:~/demisto$ pyenv versions
  3.10.5
sb@dddd:~/demisto$
```
If this doesn't work, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation). Either Homebrew for MacOS or the automatic installer on Linux/WSL work fine.

If the required version of Python is missing, you will need to install it. As `pyenv` compiles CPython, you might need some libraries. Depending on your operating system, this [article](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Common-build-problems)  explains how to install the required dependencies and provides useful troubleshooting info.

Now is a good time to take a break since installing might take a while.

Install Python 3.10.5:

```bash
sb@dddd:~/demisto$ pyenv install 3.10.5
Downloading Python-3.10.5.tar.xz...
-> https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.5/Python-3.10.5.tar.xz
Installing Python-3.10.5...
Installed Python-3.10.5 to /home/sb/.pyenv/versions/3.10.5

sb@dddd:~/demisto$ pyenv versions
  3.10.5
sb@dddd:~/demisto$
```
And that's it! Again, if the installation fails, check out [this](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Common-build-problems) page.

##### Poetry

Follow these instructions to install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installing-with-the-official-installer)

##### Node

Follow these [instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) to install the `nvm` package manager.

After installing, run:
```bash
nvm install node
```

##### Bootstrap

Before running the `bootstrap` script that creates the virtual environment, let's set up `pyenv` to work correctly in the `content` folder you just cloned.

At the beginning, no local python interpreter has been set via `pyenv`:
```bash
sb@dddd:~/demisto$ cd content
sb@dddd:~/demisto/content$ pyenv local
pyenv: no local version configured for this directory
```

You can tell `pyenv` to use the latest version Python 3 you previously installed and verify that everything is set correctly:
```
sb@dddd:~/demisto/content$ pyenv local 3.10.5

sb@dddd:~/demisto/content$ pyenv local
3.10.5

sb@dddd:~/demisto/content$ which python3
/home/sb/.pyenv/shims/python3

sb@dddd:~/demisto/content$ python3 -V
Ptyhon 3.10.5
```

Now you can run the `.hooks/bootstrap` script that will install the dependencies and create the `poetry` environment:
```bash
sb@dddd:~/demisto/content$ .hooks/bootstrap
Installing 'pre-commit' hooks
=======================
Configure poetry to install virtual environment in the project repo (will be available in (.venv)
Check if poetry files are valid
All set!
Installing dependencies...
Detected local env.
Installing dependencies from lock file

No dependencies to install or update
==========================
Done setting up virtualenv with poetry
Activate the venv by running: poetry shell
Deactivate by running: deactivate
=======================
Running: npm install ...

up to date, audited 230 packages in 1s
```

*Note*: if you are using WSL and you see some errors about "python.exe" getting called, disable it in App Execution Alias ([details](https://superuser.com/questions/1437590/typing-python-on-windows-10-version-1903-command-prompt-opens-microsoft-stor)).

Everything is configured, and you can start developing. When you work on your integration, you can activate `poetry` with the `poetry shell` command:
```bash
sb@dddd:~/demisto/content$ poetry shell
(.venv) sb@dddd:~/demisto/content$
```

Note the `(.venv)` in front of the prompt. You can always leave the `poetry` virtual environment using the `deactivate` command:

```bash
(.venv) sb@dddd:~/demisto/content$ deactivate
sb@dddd:~/demisto/content$
```

### Step 5: Run the linter and unit tests

Our content ships with an `HelloWorld` integration that provides basic functionality and is useful to understand how to create integrations.

It's located in the `Packs/HelloWorld/Integrations/HelloWorld` folder. We will use `demisto-sdk` to run the *linting* and *unit testing* in order to make sure that everything is fine with the dev environment (python, docker, etc.).

First, make sure you are running inside the `poetry` virtual environment:
```bash
sb@dddd:~/demisto/content$ poetry shell
(.venv) sb@dddd:~/demisto/content$
```

Then, make sure that `demisto-sdk` has been installed automatically by the bootstrap script as part of the preqreuisites:
```bash
(venv) sb@dddd:~/demisto/content$ demisto-sdk
Use demisto-sdk -h to see the available commands.
```

Now, run the `demisto-sdk lint` command on the folder `Packs/HelloWorld/Integrations/HelloWorld` using the `-i` option,
 or if you want to run  against all the committed files in your branch you can use `demisto-sdk lint -g`.
It will run both the [linters](../integrations/linting) and [pytest](../integrations/unit-testing):
```bash
(venv) sb@dddd:~/demisto/content$ demisto-sdk lint -i Packs/HelloWorld/Integrations/HelloWorld
Execute lint and test on 1/1 packages

Note that the tests run within a Docker container so, if everything worked well, it means that your development environment is up and running correctly!

### Step 6: Create a branch 

The [Git Flow](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests) requires to create a *branch* with your new code, that you will later use to submit a *Pull Request*. This tutorial doesn't mean to be an exhaustive guide on how to use `git`: its purpose is just to make sure that you have all the requirements and tools in place to successfully develop a Cortex XSOAR Integration.

In order to create a branch, use the  `git checkout -b [branch_name]` command, where the name of the branch corresponds to your integration:

```bash
(venv) sb@dddd:~/demisto/content$ git checkout -b my_integration_name
Switched to a new branch 'my_integration_name'
```
### Step 7: Create your integration directory
Create a directory under `Packs/<Your pack name>` named after your product where you will put all your content files later, and add it to the staged changes in `git`. Make sure you use **PascalCase** in the directory name (i.e. `MyIntegration`). 
For a detailed description regarding what exactly a pack is please click [here](../packs/packs-format). 

You can create a Pack and an Integration directory using the [`demisto-sdk init` command](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk/blob/master/demisto_sdk/commands/init/README.md).
An example of creating a pack called `MyNewPack`, with an integration called `MyIntegration`, and with the metadata file created automatically: 
```bash
➜  content-docs2 git:(add-pack-and-sdk-docs) ✗ demisto-sdk init --pack 
Please input the name of the initialized pack: MyNewPack
Successfully created the pack test in: MyIntegration

Do you want to fill pack's metadata file? Y/N y

Display name of the pack: MyNewPack

Description of the pack: A description for my newly created pack.

Support type of the pack: 
[1] demisto
[2] partner
[3] developer
[4] community

Enter option: 2

Server min version: 5.0.0

Author of the pack: Partner name 

The url of support, should represent your GitHub account (optional): https://github.com/<PartnerGitAccount>

The email in which you can be contacted in: partner@partner.com

Pack category options: 
[1] Analytics & SIEM
[2] Utilities
[3] Messaging
[4] Endpoint
[5] Network Security
[6] Vulnerability Management
[7] Case Management
[8] Forensics & Malware Analysis
[9] IT Services
[10] Data Enrichment & Threat Intelligence
[11] Authentication
[12] Database
[13] Deception
[14] Email Gateway

Enter option: 1

Tags of the pack, comma separated values: 
Created pack metadata at path : MyNewPack/metadata.json

Do you want to create an integration in the pack? Y/N y
Please input the name of the initialized integration: test
Do you want to use the directory name as an ID for the integration? Y/N y
Finished creating integration: MyNewPack/Integrations/test.

```

### Step 8: Commit and push

The last step is to `commit` your changes and `push` them to the *origin* in order to make sure that the pre-commit checks work fine.

But you can also run the hooks locally using the demisto-sdk, in order to do that you can run the commands:  
1. `demisto-sdk format` - this will auto correct couple of things in order for our validation to pass. 
You can see the [docs](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk/blob/master/demisto_sdk/commands/format/README.md)  
2. `demisto-sdk validate -g` - this will validate the integrity of the yml files, and will make sure they follow 
our pre-set of roles. You can see the [docs](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk/blob/master/demisto_sdk/commands/validate/README.md)  
3. `demisto-sdk lint -i <The path to your changed/newly added content entity>` - this will run lint and pytest on your 
changed python files. You can see the [docs](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk/blob/master/demisto_sdk/commands/lint/README.md)  



First, run a `git commit -m '[some commit message]'`, which will automatically run the pre validation checks:


```bash
(venv) sb@dddd:~/demisto/content$ git commit -m 'Initial commit of MyIntegration'
Validating files...
Starting validating files structure
Using git
Running validation on branch my_integration_name
Validates only committed files
Starting validation against origin/master
The files are valid
Starting secrets detection
Finished validating secrets, no secrets were found.

Skipping running dev tasks (flake8, mypy, pylint, pytest). If you want to run this as part of the precommit hook
set CONTENT_PRECOMMIT_RUN_DEV_TASKS=1. You can add the following line to ~/.zshrc:
echo "export CONTENT_PRECOMMIT_RUN_DEV_TASKS=1" >> ~/.zshrc

Or if you want to manually run dev tasks: ./Tests/scripts/pkg_dev_test_tasks.py -d <integration/script dir>
Example: ./Tests/scripts/pkg_dev_test_tasks.py -d Scripts/ParseEmailFiles

On branch my_integration_name
Untracked files:
        .python-version

nothing added to commit but untracked files present
```

Don't worry about the `.python-version` file warning, that is generated by  `pyenv` and shouldn't be added to the repository.

*Note*: since there are no files yet in the directory you have created (`Integrations/MyIntegration` in the example), it will not show up in your branch after the commit. Again, the purpose of this tutorial is just to make sure that all the components are in place.

If everything worked fine so far, now you can *push* to your branch with the command `git push origin [branch_name]`. You will be prompted for your GitHub credentials:

```bash
(venv) sb@dddd:~/demisto/content$ git push origin my_integration_name
Username for 'https://github.com': [omitted]
Password for 'https://[omitted]@github.com':
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
remote:
remote: Create a pull request for 'my_integration_name' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/[omitted]/content/pull/new/my_integration_name
remote:
To https://github.com/[omitted]/content
 * [new branch]          my_integration_name -> my_integration_name
(venv) sb@dddd:~/demisto/content$
```

You can go back to GitHub and, under **your** fork, you should be able to see that there is a new branch with the name you provided (`my_integration_name` in this example):

![GitHub Branch](/doc_imgs/tutorials/tut-setup-dev/06-githubbranch.png)

Congratulations! You completed the set up of the Development Environment for Cortex XSOAR! Now you can start writing your code. Please have a look at the [Code Conventions](../integrations/code-conventions).
