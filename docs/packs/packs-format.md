title: Content Packs Structure
---

For better separation between Content artifacts from different use cases and Partners we use a directory structure called `Content Packs`. Each `Content Pack` behaves like a mini content repo. It contains all relevant content items within its directory.

For instance a pack for CortexXDR will look as can be seen in the Content Repository 
[Packs/CortexXDR](https://github.com/demisto/content/tree/master/Packs/CortexXDR).

To generate a new pack make sure to use: `demisto-sdk init --pack`. Detailed command instructions are available [here](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk/blob/master/demisto_sdk/commands/init/README.md).

**Note**: The Content repo is going through a transition phase to move all content into packs. During this phase you will see some Content artifacts are still not maintained within Packs. All new Content should be maintained via Packs.

## Directories  
All the directories within the pack are the representation of all the possible entities possible in Content. And the pack will be located in the Content repo under `Packs/<Pack Name>`
```
- Integrations        
- Scripts
- Playbooks
- Reports
- Dashboards
- IncidentTypes
- IncidentFields
- Layouts
- Classifiers
- IndicatorTypes
- IndicatorFields
- Connections
- TestPlaybooks
```

## Pack files
The pack directory contains numerous configuration files used for metadata and documentation. 

Please note that all of the following files will be created using the `demisto-sdk init --pack`, and some of them 
will have to be filled by you. An explanation for each of them will be provided below.
 
### pack_metadata.json

### README.md
The file contains a general explanation for the pack and you are free to add any information relevant for the pack. For more details refer to the [Pack Documentation](../documentation/pack-docs) page.

### .secrets-ignore
This file will be used while running the `demisto-sdk secrets`([explanation](https://github.com/demisto/demisto-sdk/blob/master/demisto_sdk/commands/secrets/README.md)), we will determine the file and will
 use it as a  white list of approved words for your PR.

**Note**: We use `demisto-sdk secrets` as part of our pre-commit hook to check that possible secrets in the PR aren't exposed to a public repository.

### .pack-ignore
This file allows ignoring linter errors while lint checking and ignoring tests in the test collection.

To add ignored tests/linter errors in a file, first, add the file name to the **.pack-ignore** in this format
```
[file:integration-to-ignore.yml]
```

On the following line add `ignore=` flag, with one or more comma-separated values:
1. `auto-test` - ignore test file in the build test collection.
2. `linter code` e.g. IN126 - ignore linter error codes.

#### Example .pack-ignore
```
[file:playbook-Special-Test-Not-To-Run-Directly.yml]
ignore=auto-test

[file:integration-to-ignore.yml]
ignore=IN126,PA116
```

### Author_image.png
This file is optional, and if added the image will be displayed in the Marketplace under **PUBLISHER** when viewing the pack details.

In case file does not exist, the pack author will be displayed in text.

The image size should be up to 4kb and in the dimensions of 120x50.
